  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a CADD-Solis pump triggers air-in-line alarms during infusion,
    unexpected alarms with no visible air bubbles, or frequent alarms disrupting therapy. 
    These steps focus on the most common and easily verified causes before assuming tubing failure, cassette problems, or internal sensor malfunction.
  </p>
  <p>You do not need advanced technical skills — just follow the steps carefully and observe what happens.</p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Inspect the Tubing and Cassette for Air</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Stop the pump if running.</li>
    <li>Visually inspect tubing from cassette to patient for air bubbles.</li>
    <li>Check the cassette reservoir for air.</li>
    <li>If air is present, prime the tubing according to manufacturer instructions and remove all visible air before restarting infusion.</li>
    <li>Even small air bubbles near the sensor can trigger alarms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Check Tubing Connections</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure all luer connections are secure and tight.</li>
    <li>Inspect for loose or partially connected segments.</li>
    <li>Confirm no leakage points where air could enter.</li>
    <li>Loose connections can introduce air during infusion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Confirm Proper Cassette Installation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove and reseat the cassette firmly.</li>
    <li>Ensure tubing is correctly aligned in the cassette pressure channel.</li>
    <li>Verify the cassette is fully seated and locked.</li>
    <li>Misalignment or partially seated cassettes can allow air to be detected incorrectly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Inspect Pump Orientation and Placement</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pump should be positioned per manufacturer guidelines (usually upright).</li>
    <li>Avoid placing the pump upside down or on uneven surfaces.</li>
    <li>Ensure tubing runs freely to the patient without tension.</li>
    <li>Incorrect orientation can cause the sensor to detect air incorrectly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Power Cycle the Pump</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn the pump off.</li>
    <li>Wait at least 10 seconds.</li>
    <li>Turn it back on.</li>
    <li>Reinstall cassette and tubing.</li>
    <li>Temporary sensor glitches may clear after a reboot.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6. Test with Known-Good Tubing and Cassette</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Replace cassette and tubing with new or verified working components.</li>
    <li>Attempt infusion at same settings.</li>
    <li>If alarms stop: original cassette or tubing was likely defective or had trapped air.</li>
    <li>If alarms continue: internal air-in-line sensor or logic issue is likely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>7. Observe Alarm Behavior</h4>
  <p>Document:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the alarm occur immediately upon starting infusion?</li>
    <li>Is there visible air near the sensor when alarm triggers?</li>
    <li>Does adjusting tubing or re-priming stop the alarm?</li>
    <li>Does alarm occur only at certain infusion rates or settings?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Pattern observation helps determine external vs. internal causes.</p>

  <h3>If Air-in-Line Alarms Persist</h3>
  <p>If alarms continue after completing the steps above, likely causes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Air-in-line sensor failure</li>
    <li>Pressure plate detection issues</li>
    <li>Pump logic / firmware problem</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These cannot be corrected through bedside troubleshooting. Next steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the pump from clinical service</li>
    <li>Label as Out of Service</li>
    <li>Send for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Pump repeatedly alarms for air-in-line; tubing and cassette appear clear.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Tubing and cassette inspected and replaced, pump power-cycled. False air-in-line alarms persist. Suspected internal sensor or pressure plate failure.”</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed pump from service, labeled out of service, sent for repair.”<br>
    “Tagged for CE bench evaluation.”<br>
    “Replaced defective cassette/tubing; infusion resumed without alarms.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tubing primed (yes / no)</li>
    <li>Tubing tested (yes / no)</li>
    <li>Cassette replaced/tested</li>
    <li>Pump orientation correct</li>
    <li>Alarm occurs immediately or during infusion</li>
    <li>Final disposition (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Most air-in-line alarms are caused by air trapped in tubing or cassette, loose tubing, or misaligned cassettes. Internal sensor failures are less common but possible.
  </p>
  <p>Completing these steps ensures you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out simple external causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient therapy continuity</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That is successful troubleshooting.</p>
