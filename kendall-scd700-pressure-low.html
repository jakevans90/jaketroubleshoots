  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a Kendall SCD 700 Series unit delivers pressure that appears too low, weak, inconsistent between cycles, or uneven between legs.
  </p>
  <p>
    These steps focus on the most common and easily verified causes before assuming internal pump, valve, or pressure sensor failure.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills — just follow the steps and observe carefully.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Confirm Therapy Mode and Settings</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify the correct therapy mode is selected (calf vs. thigh).</li>
    <li>Confirm therapy has fully started and is cycling normally.</li>
    <li>Ensure no standby or paused state is active.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Incorrect mode or incomplete startup can mimic low pressure.</p>

  <h4>2. Check Sleeve Application</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure sleeves are wrapped snugly and evenly.</li>
    <li>Avoid loose wrapping.</li>
    <li>Confirm correct sleeve size for the patient.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Oversized sleeves often feel like low pressure even when functioning normally.</p>

  <h4>3. Inspect Tubing for Leaks or Kinks</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Check entire tubing length for cracks or pinholes.</li>
    <li>Inspect for loose fittings.</li>
    <li>Look for sharp bends or kinks.</li>
    <li>Ensure tubing is not pinched under bed rails or equipment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even a small air leak can significantly reduce delivered pressure.</p>

  <h4>4. Check Connections at the Ports</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Fully reseat tubing connectors.</li>
    <li>Listen for air escaping at connection points.</li>
    <li>Gently wiggle connectors while unit is cycling to check for intermittent leaks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Loose fittings are a common cause of inconsistent pressure.</p>

  <h4>5. Swap Sleeves and Tubing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Swap left and right sleeves.</li>
    <li>Replace tubing with a known-good set if available.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If the problem follows the sleeve → sleeve likely leaking.<br>
    If the problem follows the tubing → tubing defective.<br>
    If the issue stays with the same port → possible internal valve issue.
  </p>

  <h4>6. Listen to the Pump Cycle</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pump should sound consistent during inflation.</li>
    <li>Weak, struggling, or unusually loud pump sounds may indicate internal wear.</li>
    <li>Rapid cycling without building pressure may indicate leak or valve issue.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>7. Check for Alarms or Error Messages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Leak detected</li>
    <li>Pressure fault</li>
    <li>System error</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Record exact alarm wording if present.</p>

  <h4>8. Compare Both Channels</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Swap tubing between ports.</li>
    <li>Observe whether low pressure follows the accessory or remains with the port.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If Pressure Remains Low or Inconsistent</h3>
  <p>If the issue persists after completing the steps above, the likely causes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Internal pump wear</li>
    <li>Valve manifold failure</li>
    <li>Pressure sensor drift</li>
    <li>Internal air leak within the unit</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These cannot be corrected through bedside troubleshooting.
  </p>

  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the unit from clinical service</li>
    <li>Clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>Send for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Knowing when to escalate is part of good troubleshooting.</p>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Compression pressure weak and inconsistent on left leg.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Sleeves and tubing inspected and swapped; issue remained on left port. Suspected internal valve or pump degradation.”<br><br>
    or<br><br>
    “Issue followed sleeve when swapped. Sleeve found leaking.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Replaced defective sleeve; unit returned to service.”<br>
    “Removed device from service; sent for bench evaluation.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Which side affected (left/right/both)</li>
    <li>Alarm messages (exact wording)</li>
    <li>Sleeve size used</li>
    <li>Sleeve swapped: yes / no</li>
    <li>Tubing replaced: yes / no</li>
    <li>Pump audible and consistent: yes / no</li>
    <li>Final disposition</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Most low-pressure complaints are caused by loose tubing connections, micro-leaks in sleeves, incorrect sleeve sizing, or partially seated connectors.
  </p>

  <p>Completing these steps means you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out accessory causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary device replacement</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
