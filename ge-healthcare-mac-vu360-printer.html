  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>MAC VU360</p>

  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through steps to identify and resolve issues when the MAC VU360 printer
    either does not print at all or produces poor-quality printouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    These steps focus on the most common and easiest checks first, before advancing to more
    involved troubleshooting.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Confirm the Printer Is Enabled</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the MAC VU360 menu and verify that the internal printer function is enabled.</li>
    <li>If disabled, turn the printer on through the settings menu.</li>
    <li>Try a controlled print command to test.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Check Paper Supply</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the printer compartment and confirm correct paper is loaded (thermal paper if applicable).</li>
    <li>Ensure paper is clean, flat, and correctly oriented.</li>
    <li>Replace any paper that looks old, curled, or dirty.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Inspect Printer Roll and Sensors</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Check the paper roll for tears or dust buildup.</li>
    <li>Clean the paper path and sensors with a soft dry cloth or air duster.</li>
    <li>Verify that sensors firmly detect paper presence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Check Print Quality Settings</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Navigate to print quality settings in the system menu.</li>
    <li>Ensure contrast/density settings are at default or appropriate levels.</li>
    <li>Try increasing density slightly if output is faint.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Perform a Printer Self-Test</h4>
  <p>Print the internal self-test page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the printer test option from the system menu.</li>
    <li>Observe if the self-test prints correctly.</li>
    <li>If self-test fails or comes out poorly, suspect printer hardware or thermal head issue.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6. Check for Error Messages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Watch the monitor for any printer error codes.</li>
    <li>Record the exact message for documentation.</li>
    <li>Consult service manual for the specific code meaning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If the Printer Still Does Not Work</h3>
  <p>
    If the issue persists after the steps above, the problem is likely internal (printer mechanism,
    thermal print head, connection board, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point basic bedside checks are exhausted and further service evaluation is required.
  </p>
  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>verified printer settings</li>
    <li>checked paper supply</li>
    <li>cleaned sensors and path</li>
    <li>attempted quality adjustments</li>
    <li>triggered a self-test</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The next steps are to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the device from clinical use</li>
    <li>tag it Out of Service</li>
    <li>send it for bench service evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the user.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Printer will not print or prints very light and poor quality.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “Printer self-test fails and output is blank with appropriate paper loaded. Paper feed and sensors checked; no error resolved. Suspected thermal head failure.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed unit from service and sent for repair.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Printer mechanism replaced on bench and tested successfully.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Paper type and source</li>
    <li>Printer self-test result</li>
    <li>Error messages/codes</li>
    <li>Steps already attempted</li>
    <li>Final status (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Troubleshooting printing issues often comes down to confirming proper consumables,
    settings, and basics before assuming an internal failure. Documenting every step
    improves handoff and repair accuracy.
  </p>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
