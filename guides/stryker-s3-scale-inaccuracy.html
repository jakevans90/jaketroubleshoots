<p>S3 Bed</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Stryker S3 bed scale:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displays incorrect patient weight</li>
  <li>Shows large weight fluctuations</li>
  <li>Fails to zero properly</li>
  <li>Does not match known patient weight</li>
  <li>Produces scale error messages</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus is on external setup, environment, and user-related causes before assuming internal load cell or control board failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do not troubleshoot scale accuracy with a patient on the bed</li>
  <li>If weight accuracy is clinically necessary, transfer the patient to a verified scale first</li>
  <li>Ensure brakes are engaged before performing any checks</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify the Bed Is on a Level Surface</h4>
<p>The S3 scale system relies on load cells located at the frame. Uneven flooring or one caster elevated can cause inaccurate readings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure all four casters are fully on the floor</li>
  <li>Confirm the bed is not partially on a floor transition</li>
  <li>Check that brakes are engaged</li>
  <li>If necessary, relocate the bed to a known level surface and recheck</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ensure Nothing Is Touching the Bed</h4>
<p>External contact is one of the most common causes of scale inaccuracy.</p>
<p>Check for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IV poles resting on the floor</li>
  <li>Foley bags hanging and touching the ground</li>
  <li>Bed linens caught between the bed and wall</li>
  <li>Oxygen tubing pulling against a wall</li>
  <li>Bed contacting a bedside cabinet or wall</li>
</ul>
<p>The bed must be completely free-floating for accurate weight.</p>

<h4>Confirm Proper Zeroing Procedure</h4>
<p>If the bed was not zeroed properly, the displayed weight will be inaccurate.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove all items from the bed surface</li>
  <li>Ensure no linens or accessories are pressing against frame</li>
  <li>Zero the scale according to normal operational procedure</li>
  <li>Wait for weight to stabilize before adding patient</li>
</ul>
<p>If zero fails repeatedly, power cycle the bed and attempt again.</p>

<h4>Check for Added or Removed Equipment After Weighing</h4>
<p>Common issue:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Staff remove SCD pump, wedges, or positioning devices without re-zeroing</li>
  <li>Additional equipment added after baseline weight</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm all equipment present during zero is still present</li>
  <li>Or perform a new zero with known configuration</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect Mattress and Deck Position</h4>
<p>Improper deck positioning may cause uneven load distribution.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lower bed to flat position</li>
  <li>Ensure all deck sections are fully lowered</li>
  <li>Confirm mattress is properly seated</li>
  <li>Check that no deck actuator is partially engaged</li>
</ul>
<p>Recheck weight after leveling bed.</p>

<h4>Inspect for Obvious Mechanical Issues</h4>
<p>Without disassembling:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look for visibly bent frame</li>
  <li>Check caster assemblies for binding</li>
  <li>Listen for abnormal creaking when weight shifts</li>
  <li>Observe if weight changes significantly when head section moves</li>
</ul>
<p>Significant fluctuations during articulation may indicate load cell or internal wiring concerns.</p>

<h4>Power Reset</h4>
<p>If scale readings are erratic:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disconnect bed from AC power</li>
  <li>Remove battery power if accessible (without disassembly)</li>
  <li>Wait 60 seconds</li>
  <li>Reconnect and retest</li>
</ul>
<p>This can reset scale controller communication.</p>

<h4>Cross-Check With Known Weight</h4>
<p>If possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a calibrated test weight</li>
  <li>Or compare with another verified bed scale</li>
</ul>
<p>If variance exceeds facility tolerance (commonly ±0.5–1 lb or per policy), further evaluation is required.</p>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If all external and environmental causes have been ruled out, the likely causes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faulty load cell</li>
  <li>Scale controller board issue</li>
  <li>Internal wiring fault</li>
  <li>Calibration drift beyond allowable range</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the bed from service</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service</li>
  <li>Send for bench evaluation or authorized repair</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not attempt internal load cell adjustment without proper calibration tools and manufacturer procedure.</p>
<p>Knowing when to escalate is proper troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never troubleshoot a bed scale with a patient on it.</p>
<p>If weight accuracy is clinically necessary (e.g., critical care, medication dosing), transfer the patient to a verified scale before investigating.</p>
<p>Patient safety always comes first.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Nursing reported bed weight reading 18 lbs higher than expected for patient.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“IV pole was resting on floor and contacting wall, affecting scale reading.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Freed IV pole from floor contact, re-zeroed bed scale, verified accurate reading within tolerance. Returned bed to service.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested (if power reset performed)</li>
  <li>Bed location</li>
  <li>Error messages displayed</li>
  <li>Zero procedure performed</li>
  <li>Floor condition</li>
  <li>Final verified weight</li>
  <li>Final device status</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Scale inaccuracies are frequently caused by environmental or setup issues rather than internal failure. Logical, external checks protect patient safety and prevent unnecessary repairs. When internal components are suspected, proper escalation and clear documentation protect both the patient and the department.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
