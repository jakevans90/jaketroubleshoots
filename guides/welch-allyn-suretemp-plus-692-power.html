<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Welch Allyn SureTemp Plus 692 thermometer fails to power on or experiences random shutdowns during use. It focuses on external, easily verifiable causes first—such as battery condition, battery contacts, power adapters, and environmental factors—before assuming internal electronics failure. The goal is to restore reliable operation safely and efficiently.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Check Battery Condition</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the battery from the thermometer.</li>
  <li>Inspect for corrosion, leakage, or swelling.</li>
  <li>Replace with a fully charged, compatible battery if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Weak or damaged batteries are the most common cause of power issues or random shutdowns.</p>

<h4>Inspect Battery Contacts</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the contacts inside the battery compartment are clean and free of debris.</li>
  <li>Lightly clean contacts with a dry cloth or a pencil eraser if corrosion is present.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Poor contact can prevent power delivery even if the battery is good.</p>

<h4>Test with a Known Good Battery</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Insert a new or verified fully charged battery.</li>
  <li>Power on the thermometer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Confirms whether the issue is battery-related or device-related.</p>

<h4>Check Power Adapter (if using AC/charging)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify the AC adapter is rated correctly for the device.</li>
  <li>Confirm outlet functionality by testing with another device.</li>
  <li>Inspect adapter and cable for fraying or damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Power supply problems can cause random shutdowns or prevent startup.</p>

<h4>Inspect Thermometer Housing</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check for signs of physical damage or moisture ingress.</li>
  <li>Ensure the unit is not excessively hot or cold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Environmental extremes can trigger protective shutdowns or damage internal circuits.</p>

<h4>Reset the Device (if applicable)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Some SureTemp 692 models allow a power reset by removing batteries for 1–2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Reinsert batteries and power on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Resets any transient electronic faults.</p>

<h4>Observe Operation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Power on and monitor for stability.</li>
  <li>Note any pattern of shutdowns (immediately after powering on, during measurement, or randomly).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Helps narrow down whether the issue is intermittent or consistent.</p>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If all external checks are normal and the device still won’t power reliably:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the thermometer from service.</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service.</li>
  <li>Send it for bench evaluation or repair by an authorized service provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Continuing to use a device with random shutdowns risks inaccurate patient temperature readings.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never troubleshoot on an actively monitored patient.</p>
<p>Move the patient to another verified working thermometer before performing any troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Ensure patient safety remains the top priority.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Thermometer will not power on or randomly shuts down during use.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Battery contacts were corroded and original battery was weak.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Cleaned battery contacts, replaced with a fully charged battery, device powers on consistently.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Battery type and voltage</li>
  <li>Presence of any corrosion or leakage</li>
  <li>AC adapter voltage and outlet tested</li>
  <li>Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity)</li>
  <li>Any error codes displayed</li>
  <li>Final device status after troubleshooting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Power issues in portable thermometers are frequently caused by batteries, contacts, or power adapters rather than internal electronics. Logical, stepwise troubleshooting ensures patient safety, minimizes downtime, and avoids unnecessary repairs. Proper documentation helps maintain device reliability records.</p>
<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
