<h3>Asset Type</h3>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Dräger</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Fabius</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where a Fabius anesthesia machine ventilator fails its self-test or does not start. It focuses on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes first, such as power, connections, setup errors, and configuration issues, before assuming internal ventilator failure. Patient safety is the primary concern, so troubleshooting should only be done when no patient is on the ventilator.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure Power Supply and Connection</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the machine is plugged into a verified hospital-grade outlet.</li>
  <li>Check that the main power switch is ON.</li>
  <li>Inspect the power cord for damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Anesthesia machines will not complete self-tests without stable power.</p>

<h4>Check Backup Battery Status</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the machine uses a battery, verify it is charged and properly seated.</li>
  <li>Some Fabius models require a battery to be functional to pass self-test.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify Gas Supply and Hoses</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure all medical gases (O₂, N₂O, air) are connected and pressure is within specification.</li>
  <li>Confirm that the hoses are properly attached and there are no leaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Gas pressure sensors can prevent self-test completion if insufficient.</p>

<h4>Inspect Breathing Circuit and Accessories</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove any patient circuit attachments, filters, or breathing bags that may obstruct the system.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the ventilator circuit is properly mounted and clamps are released.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Obstructions or misaligned components can cause self-test failure.</p>

<h4>Check for Active Alarms or Fault Indicators</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Review the display for messages that may indicate sensor errors, disconnected components, or service reminders.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Power Cycle the Machine</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Turn off the machine, wait 30–60 seconds, and restart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: A simple reset often clears temporary faults in software or sensors.</p>

<h4>Run Self-Test with Minimal Configuration</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Disconnect optional modules or accessories.</li>
  <li>Run self-test again to see if the issue persists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If all above steps are verified and the ventilator still fails self-test or won’t start:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the machine from service.</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service.</li>
  <li>Escalate to Dräger service or Biomedical Engineering bench evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attempting internal repair without proper training may be unsafe and void warranty.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Never attempt ventilator troubleshooting while a patient is connected.</li>
  <li>Move the patient to an alternate anesthesia machine before performing any checks.</li>
  <li>Always ensure emergency airway equipment is immediately available during testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Ventilator fails self-test and will not start; machine displays error code during pre-use check.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Power supply and gas connections verified; breathing circuit removed; self-test continues to fail, suggesting internal ventilator or sensor fault.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Machine removed from service, labeled Out of Service, and sent for Dräger bench evaluation/service.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested with another device.</li>
  <li>Power cord inspected.</li>
  <li>Gas pressures verified.</li>
  <li>Breathing circuit removed for testing.</li>
  <li>Display error codes captured (if any).</li>
  <li>Machine status: Out of Service pending repair.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Patient safety is paramount. Systematic, logic-based troubleshooting avoids unnecessary risk and ensures only qualified personnel attempt repair. Documenting each step preserves institutional knowledge and supports future preventive maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
