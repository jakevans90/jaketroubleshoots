<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where a Hillrom Progressa bed reports brake or steering faults, or the bed is difficult to maneuver or does not lock properly. It focuses on external, easily verifiable causes first—such as wheel alignment, locking mechanism engagement, or debris—before assuming internal mechanical or electronic failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Verify Patient Safety</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the bed is not occupied or the patient has been safely transferred if troubleshooting requires moving the bed.</li>
  <li>This prevents accidental injury during manipulation of brakes or wheels.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Brake Engagement</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Inspect each wheel to ensure brakes are fully engaged.</li>
  <li>Manually press the brake pedals and attempt to gently move the bed.</li>
  <li>Uneven engagement may indicate a misaligned brake or mechanical obstruction.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect Wheels and Casters</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Look for debris, hair, or bedding caught in the casters.</li>
  <li>Check that all wheels rotate freely when brakes are released.</li>
  <li>A jammed wheel can cause steering resistance and false brake fault alerts.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Steering Lock / Directional Caster Function</h4>
<ul>
  <li>For beds with directional casters, ensure they pivot freely.</li>
  <li>Verify that the steering lock mechanism (if present) is fully disengaged.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Examine Electronic Brake Sensor (if equipped)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the bed has electronic brake sensors, confirm the connectors at the wheels are seated properly.</li>
  <li>Look for visible damage to wiring harnesses or sensors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Test Bed on Flat Surface</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Place the bed on a flat, even surface.</li>
  <li>Test braking and steering while observing for inconsistencies or fault messages.</li>
  <li>Faults that only occur on certain floor types may indicate caster or sensor sensitivity.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cycle Power (Electronic Beds Only)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Disconnect power briefly (unplug AC or remove battery if safe).</li>
  <li>Reconnect and observe if faults clear.</li>
  <li>This resets sensor systems without requiring internal repair.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>Common external causes have been ruled out. The bed should be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removed from service</li>
  <li>Labeled Out of Service</li>
  <li>Sent for Hillrom repair or bench evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>Stopping here avoids unsafe internal interventions and protects both patient and technician.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Never attempt bed movement over thresholds or uneven surfaces while brakes are malfunctioning.</li>
  <li>Always ensure patient is relocated or adequately secured before troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>Document any fault codes displayed during testing for follow-up with repair team.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Bed reports “Brake Fault” on control panel and is difficult to maneuver.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Observed debris in rear caster and partial brake pedal engagement; sensors appeared functional after visual inspection.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Cleared debris, fully engaged brakes, and cycled bed power; fault cleared. Bed returned to service.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Floor surface during testing</li>
  <li>Number of wheels with obstruction or resistance</li>
  <li>Alarm or error messages displayed</li>
  <li>Visual condition of brake pedals and casters</li>
  <li>Any unusual sounds when engaging brakes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Proper troubleshooting balances patient safety, logical verification of external components, and careful escalation when mechanical or sensor faults persist. Thorough documentation helps maintain a safe hospital environment and supports efficient repair workflows.</p>
<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
