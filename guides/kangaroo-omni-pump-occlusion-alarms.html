<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a Cardinal Health Kangaroo Omni feeding pump is generating occlusion alarms.</p>
<p>The focus is on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes—such as tubing setup, formula viscosity, and patient line restrictions—before assuming internal pump malfunction. These steps prioritize patient safety, proper escalation, and clear documentation.</p>

<h4>Ensure the Patient Is Safe First</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Before troubleshooting, confirm the patient has been transitioned to an alternate feeding method or backup pump if continuous feeding is required.</li>
  <li>Do not troubleshoot on an actively dependent patient.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify the Alarm Message</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm whether the alarm indicates upstream occlusion (feeding bag side) or downstream occlusion (patient side).</li>
  <li>This determines where you begin your inspection.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect the Administration Set Installation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Open the pump door and verify:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The correct Kangaroo Omni-compatible set is being used.</li>
    <li>The tubing is fully seated in the pump channel.</li>
    <li>There are no twists, misalignment, or tension in the tubing.</li>
    <li><em>Improper loading is one of the most common causes of occlusion alarms.</em></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Check for Kinks or Clamps</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Trace the entire line from feeding bag → pump → patient.</li>
  <li>Look for:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Closed roller clamps</li>
    <li>Kinked tubing</li>
    <li>Tubing caught in bed rails</li>
    <li>Compression under the patient</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Assess the Feeding Bag and Formula</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the bag is properly vented if required.</li>
  <li>Confirm the formula is not excessively thick.</li>
  <li>Check for formula that has separated or clotted.</li>
  <li><em>High-viscosity formulas can trigger downstream occlusion alarms, especially at higher programmed rates.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify Patient Tube Patency (Clinical Coordination Required)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Coordinate with nursing staff to confirm:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The feeding tube has been flushed per protocol.</li>
    <li>There is no suspected clog in the enteral tube.</li>
    <li><em>Clinical Engineering should not manipulate patient tubes directly unless policy allows and it is clinically appropriate.</em></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Review Pump Settings</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm programmed rate is appropriate.</li>
  <li>Check for recent rate increases.</li>
  <li><em>Higher flow rates increase pressure and can trigger alarms in marginal setups.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4>Test with a New Administration Set</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If no visible restriction is found:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Replace the feeding set with a new one.</li>
    <li>Reprime and test operation using water (if off patient).</li>
    <li><em>Internal check valves in disposable sets can occasionally malfunction.</em></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Perform Functional Test Off Patient</h4>
<ul>
  <li>With a test bag of water:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Run the pump at a moderate rate.</li>
    <li>Observe for recurring occlusion alarms.</li>
    <li>If alarms continue under test conditions with new tubing, internal pressure sensing or pump mechanism issues may be present.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If tubing, formula, setup, and patient-related causes have been ruled out, the issue is likely internal (pressure sensor calibration drift, drive mechanism resistance, or internal obstruction).</li>
  <li>At this point:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the device from service.</li>
    <li>Label it Out of Service.</li>
    <li>Send for bench evaluation or authorized repair.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><em>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary risk and demonstrates proper troubleshooting discipline.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Never silence repeated occlusion alarms without identifying the cause. Enteral feeding interruptions can impact patient nutrition delivery and increase aspiration risk if improperly managed.</li>
  <li>Always ensure the patient has a safe alternative feeding method before removing the pump from service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p>Nursing reports feeding pump repeatedly alarming “Occlusion” and stopping feed.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Unit reports Kangaroo Omni alarming occlusion every 5–10 minutes during continuous feed.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Determined tubing kinked under bed rail / clogged feeding set / malfunctioning administration set / internal pump fault.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Found downstream tubing kinked at bed frame causing back pressure.”<br>
or<br>
“Alarm persisted with new set and water test; suspect internal pressure sensing issue.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p>Corrected external cause or removed from service.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Replaced feeding set, reprime completed, tested normal operation.”<br>
“Adjusted tubing routing; no further alarms during 15-minute test.”<br>
“Removed from service and sent to vendor for evaluation.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Upstream or downstream alarm type</li>
  <li>Feeding rate programmed</li>
  <li>Formula type and viscosity</li>
  <li>Tubing replaced (yes/no)</li>
  <li>Test performed with water (yes/no)</li>
  <li>Alarm frequency</li>
  <li>Any unusual noise or mechanical resistance</li>
  <li>Final device status (Returned to Service / Sent to Repair)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Effective troubleshooting starts with the simplest mechanical and setup causes before assuming device failure. Occlusion alarms are often external and correctable. Clear documentation and timely escalation protect both patient safety and equipment reliability.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
