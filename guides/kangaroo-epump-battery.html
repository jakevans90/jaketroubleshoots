<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Feeding Pump</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Cardinal Health</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Kangaroo ePump</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Kangaroo ePump feeding pump:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fails to power on</li>
  <li>Powers off unexpectedly</li>
  <li>Shows low battery warnings despite charging</li>
  <li>Does not hold a charge</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus is on external, easily verifiable causes first—such as battery condition, charger, and connections—before assuming internal battery or electronics failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Verify External Power Source</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the pump is connected to a known working AC outlet.</li>
  <li>Check for tripped breakers or faulty outlets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: If the outlet is dead, the pump cannot charge or operate.</p>

<h4>Inspect Power Cord and AC Adapter</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Examine the power cord and adapter for cuts, frays, or bent prongs.</li>
  <li>Swap with a known good adapter if available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Damaged cords can prevent charging or intermittent power.</p>

<h4>Check Battery Seating</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the battery and reseat it firmly.</li>
  <li>Ensure contacts are clean, free of debris, and not corroded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Poor contact can prevent the pump from drawing power.</p>

<h4>Verify Battery Charge Level</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Allow the pump to charge for the recommended minimum time (typically several hours).</li>
  <li>Observe battery indicator lights for charging status.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: A deeply discharged battery may need extended charging.</p>

<h4>Swap with Known Good Battery (if available)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Install a fully charged spare battery to see if the pump powers on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Confirms whether the battery or pump electronics are at fault.</p>

<h4>Inspect for Visible Damage</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Look for signs of liquid exposure, cracks, or impact damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: External damage can cause internal power issues or short circuits.</p>

<h4>Perform Soft Reset (if recommended by manufacturer)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Follow the ePump manual procedure for reset or power cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why: Clears temporary errors that can prevent boot-up.</p>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>External causes (power source, cord, battery seating) have been ruled out.</p>
<p>Likely internal battery failure, charging circuit, or mainboard issue.</p>
<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the pump from service.</li>
  <li>Label Out of Service.</li>
  <li>Send for repair or bench evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Knowing when to escalate is proper troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not troubleshoot on an active feeding patient.</li>
  <li>Transfer the patient to another working pump before testing.</li>
  <li>Always ensure backup feeding options are available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Pump will not turn on and shows battery empty.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Battery seated correctly but failed to hold charge; AC adapter verified working.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Pump removed from service, labeled Out of Service, sent for repair/bench evaluation.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested and functional</li>
  <li>AC adapter swapped and verified</li>
  <li>Battery inspected for corrosion or swelling</li>
  <li>Charging indicator behavior observed</li>
  <li>Pump response to soft reset</li>
  <li>Any unusual sounds or smells</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Patient safety and logic-based troubleshooting are paramount. Start with external verifications before assuming internal failure. Accurate documentation ensures proper follow-up and helps track recurring issues. Escalation when necessary is part of responsible device management.</p>
<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
