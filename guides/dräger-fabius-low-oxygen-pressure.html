<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where a Fabius anesthesia machine shows low oxygen pressure or the O₂ flush function is not performing correctly. The focus is on simple, external, and verifiable causes first—such as supply issues, hoses, and flow controls—before assuming internal machine failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Verify Oxygen Supply</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check that the oxygen cylinder or pipeline supply is full and turned on.</li>
  <li>Confirm the correct pressure at the machine inlet using the pressure gauge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Low or empty supply is the most common cause of low oxygen pressure alarms.</p>

<h4>Inspect Hoses and Connections</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Visually inspect the oxygen hose from the source to the machine.</li>
  <li>Ensure all connections are tight and free of kinks, cracks, or leaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Even small leaks can reduce pressure and prevent the O₂ flush from functioning properly.</p>

<h4>Check the Oxygen Flowmeter</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify that the flowmeter knob is in the correct position.</li>
  <li>Ensure the flowmeter tube and bobbin move freely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Obstructions or misalignment can prevent proper flow and pressure.</p>

<h4>Test O₂ Flush Function</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Press the O₂ flush button briefly. Observe whether the oxygen flows rapidly into the circuit.</li>
  <li>If the flush is weak or absent, note any unusual sounds or behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: A faulty flush valve or blocked pathway may indicate internal components need servicing.</p>

<h4>Check for Machine Alarms or Messages</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Review the display panel for any error messages related to oxygen supply or pressure.</li>
  <li>Follow any suggested external corrective actions listed by the machine.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Power Cycle the Machine</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Turn the machine off and back on per manufacturer instructions.</li>
  <li>Confirm if the low oxygen pressure alarm persists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Some sensors or valves may reset after power cycling.</p>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>All external causes have been ruled out.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the machine from service and label it Out of Service.</li>
  <li>Escalate to Dräger service or a qualified repair bench.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reminder: Knowing when to stop and escalate is proper troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Never troubleshoot oxygen issues on a patient actively receiving anesthesia.</li>
  <li>Ensure a backup oxygen source or machine is available before performing any checks.</li>
  <li>Only operate the machine with patients once proper oxygen delivery is confirmed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
"Low oxygen pressure alarm and weak O₂ flush observed."</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
"Oxygen cylinder was low and supply hose had a minor kink reducing flow."</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
"Replaced cylinder, straightened hose, verified O₂ flush function; machine returned to service."</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Supply pressure at machine inlet</li>
  <li>Oxygen cylinder status (full/empty)</li>
  <li>Condition of hoses and connections</li>
  <li>Alarm type and behavior</li>
  <li>O₂ flush response (strong/weak/absent)</li>
  <li>Final machine status after troubleshooting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Always prioritize patient safety by confirming oxygen delivery first. Use a logical, stepwise approach, ruling out external factors before assuming internal failure. Document each step clearly in CCR format to ensure accurate records and aid future troubleshooting.</p>
<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
