<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Electrosurgical Unit (ESU)</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Valleylab</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Force FX</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Valleylab Force FX ESU displays a return electrode (patient pad) alarm and will not allow Cut or Coag activation.</p>

<p>Common symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Return electrode alarm indicator illuminated</li>
  <li>Audible alarm when attempting activation</li>
  <li>Cut and Coag modes disabled</li>
  <li>“REM” or pad-related error messages</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide focuses on logical, external, and easily verifiable causes before assuming internal REM (Return Electrode Monitoring) circuit failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do not troubleshoot while the ESU is connected to an active patient.</li>
  <li>Confirm the patient has been transitioned to another ESU if surgery is ongoing.</li>
  <li>Verify the generator is in standby mode before making adjustments.</li>
  <li>This prevents unintended activation and protects the patient.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify Return Electrode Is Properly Applied</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the pad is fully adhered to clean, dry, hair-free skin.</li>
  <li>Check for partial lifting, wrinkles, or air pockets.</li>
  <li>Ensure correct pad placement over a large, well-vascularized muscle mass.</li>
  <li>Poor pad contact is the most common cause of REM alarms.</li>
  <li>If the pad appears compromised, replace it with a new one.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirm Correct Pad Type</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify that a split (REM-compatible) return electrode is being used.</li>
  <li>Ensure it is compatible with the Valleylab Force FX REM system.</li>
  <li>Using a solid (non-split) pad or incompatible pad will trigger alarms and prevent activation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect the Return Electrode Cable</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check for bent pins, loose connectors, or damaged insulation.</li>
  <li>Ensure the connector is fully seated in the return electrode port.</li>
  <li>Wiggle the connector gently to see if the alarm clears or intermittently changes.</li>
  <li>If damage is noted, replace the cable and retest.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Swap with a Known-Good Cable</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Disconnect the current return electrode cable.</li>
  <li>Connect a known-good cable.</li>
  <li>Attach to a new pad (not the existing one).</li>
  <li>If the alarm clears, the issue was likely cable-related.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check for Fluid Contamination</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Inspect the return electrode port for saline, prep solution, or debris.</li>
  <li>Ensure the connector is dry and free of contamination.</li>
  <li>Moisture can interfere with REM sensing and cause persistent alarms.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Power Cycle the Unit</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Turn the unit off.</li>
  <li>Wait 30–60 seconds.</li>
  <li>Restart and observe whether the alarm persists.</li>
  <li>Transient REM circuit faults may clear with a reset.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Perform Functional Test (Without Patient)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Using a test pad or simulator (if available), connect the return electrode.</li>
  <li>Verify the REM indicator shows normal status.</li>
  <li>Attempt activation into an ESU analyzer.</li>
  <li>If the alarm persists with known-good accessories and no patient involved, the issue is likely internal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pad placement has been verified</li>
  <li>A new pad has been applied</li>
  <li>Cable has been swapped</li>
  <li>Port is clean and dry</li>
  <li>Alarm persists during bench testing</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is likely internal to the REM sensing circuit or generator board.</p>

<p>At this point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the device from service</li>
  <li>Label it “Out of Service”</li>
  <li>Send for qualified repair or bench evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary risk and improper internal repair.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never attempt to bypass or defeat the REM system to “get through a case.” The return electrode monitoring system is a critical patient safety feature designed to prevent burns. If a pad alarm cannot be resolved immediately and safely, transition to another ESU.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“OR staff reported return electrode alarm on Valleylab Force FX. Unit would not enable Cut or Coag during setup.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Return electrode cable found to have intermittent connection at generator plug. Alarm triggered when cable was manipulated.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Replaced return electrode cable with known-good cable. Verified REM normal indication and successful activation into ESU analyzer. Returned unit to service.”<br><br>
“Removed unit from service and sent to vendor for evaluation after alarm persisted during bench testing with new pad and cable.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>New pad applied (Yes/No)</li>
  <li>Cable swapped (Yes/No)</li>
  <li>Alarm behavior (constant/intermittent)</li>
  <li>REM indicator status</li>
  <li>ESU analyzer test results</li>
  <li>Final device status</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Return electrode alarms are most often caused by pad application or cable issues—not generator failure. Logical, external troubleshooting protects the patient and prevents unnecessary repairs. When external causes are ruled out, appropriate escalation is proper Clinical Engineering practice.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
