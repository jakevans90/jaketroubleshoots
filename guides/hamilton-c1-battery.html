    <h3>Asset Type</h3>

    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>C1</p>

    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses situations where the Hamilton C1 ventilator:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fails to power on</li>
      <li>Shows battery errors or warnings</li>
      <li>Experiences unexpected shutdowns</li>
      <li>Does not charge properly or indicates low battery despite being connected</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Focus is on external checks first—power source, battery status, connections—before assuming internal failure.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Verify AC Power Source</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the ventilator is plugged into a verified working outlet.</li>
      <li>Check for tripped circuit breakers or switched-off power strips.</li>
      <li>Why: A faulty power source is the most common cause of power-related issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inspect Power Cord and Connector</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Look for damage, fraying, or bent pins.</li>
      <li>Re-seat the cord firmly into the ventilator and outlet.</li>
      <li>Why: Loose or damaged cords can prevent proper charging or startup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check Battery Installation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove and reinstall the battery pack, ensuring it clicks fully into place.</li>
      <li>Inspect the battery contacts for corrosion or debris.</li>
      <li>Why: Improper seating or dirty contacts can prevent charging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Test Battery Charge Status</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the ventilator’s status screen to check battery level and health.</li>
      <li>If the battery shows very low charge despite being on AC power, it may have reached end-of-life.</li>
      <li>Why: Batteries degrade over time and may no longer hold sufficient charge.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Attempt Power-On Without Battery</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>With AC power connected, remove the battery and attempt to power on.</li>
      <li>Why: Confirms if the problem is battery-related versus AC/power circuitry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Swap with a Known Good Battery (if available)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Insert a verified working battery to see if the issue persists.</li>
      <li>Why: Helps isolate the problem to the battery or internal power system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>External causes have been ruled out.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ventilator should be removed from service, labeled Out of Service, and sent for repair or bench evaluation.</li>
      <li>Clinical Engineering should not attempt internal board-level repairs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Never troubleshoot battery issues on an active patient.</li>
      <li>Move the patient to another ventilator first.</li>
      <li>Only perform these checks when it is safe to do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Ventilator fails to power on, battery error displayed.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Battery pack not charging; contacts clean but battery shows 0% charge.”</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    “Replaced battery with verified functional unit; ventilator powered on successfully.”</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>AC outlet verified and working</li>
      <li>Battery health or age</li>
      <li>Any unusual sounds or indicator lights during power-on</li>
      <li>Status of ventilator during troubleshooting (powered on/off)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Patient safety is paramount. Always confirm the device is safe before use, troubleshoot logically from external causes to internal, and escalate properly when needed. Document all findings using CCR for future reference and maintenance tracking.</p>
    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
