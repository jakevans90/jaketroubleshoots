  <h2>Hamilton MR1 Ventilator</h2>
  <p>Battery / Power Failure</p>
</section>

<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">
  <h3>Asset Type</h3>
  <p>Ventilator</p>

  <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
  <p>Hamilton</p>

  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>MR1</p>

  <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
  <p>This guide addresses situations where the Hamilton MR1 ventilator:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fails to power on or unexpectedly shuts down</li>
    <li>Displays battery warnings, low battery alerts, or power failure messages</li>
    <li>Shows inconsistent battery charge readings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The focus is on checking external power sources, connections, and battery status before considering internal repair or replacement.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h4>Confirm AC Power Availability</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify the wall outlet is live using a known-working device or outlet tester.</li>
    <li>Check that the MR1 power cord is fully inserted and undamaged.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why: An MR1 may fail to power on if the outlet is dead or cord is damaged.</p>

  <h4>Inspect the Power Cord and Adapter</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Look for frays, cuts, or bent prongs on the power cord.</li>
    <li>Swap with a spare compatible power cord if available.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why: External cord damage is a common cause of power issues.</p>

  <h4>Check Battery Installation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the battery pack is fully seated in the ventilator battery compartment.</li>
    <li>Verify the battery is the correct type for the MR1.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why: Loose or incompatible batteries can prevent startup or trigger low-battery alarms.</p>

  <h4>Charge the Battery</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Connect the ventilator to AC power and allow the battery to charge for the recommended time (per manufacturer guidelines).</li>
    <li>Observe whether the charging indicator illuminates.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why: A completely drained battery may prevent power-on until partially charged.</p>

  <h4>Perform a Soft Reset / Power Cycle</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If the ventilator has a soft reset or restart procedure, perform it.</li>
    <li>Disconnect from AC power, remove the battery, wait 30 seconds, reinstall battery, and reconnect AC power.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why: Power glitches can sometimes be cleared by a complete cycle.</p>

  <h4>Swap Batteries (if available)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Test the ventilator with a known-good battery pack.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why: Confirms whether the original battery is faulty.</p>

  <h4>Observe for Alarms / Error Messages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Note any battery-related alerts or error codes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why: Error codes can help differentiate between battery failure, charger fault, or internal power module issues.</p>

  <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
  <p>All external causes have been ruled out: outlet, cord, battery, or charging issues.</p>
  <p>The ventilator should be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Removed from service</li>
    <li>Labeled Out of Service</li>
    <li>Sent to Biomedical Engineering or vendor service for bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting—do not attempt internal battery pack or power module repair.</p>

  <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Never troubleshoot the battery or power system while the ventilator is connected to a patient.</li>
    <li>Move the patient to a backup ventilator before attempting any checks.</li>
    <li>Always ensure a secondary power source or ventilator is available for patient safety.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
  <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  Ventilator fails to power on; battery warning displayed.</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  Observed that battery pack was fully drained and AC outlet was functional. Power cord intact. Battery failed to charge after extended connection.</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
  Removed battery; installed a known-good battery. Verified ventilator powers on and charges correctly. Labeled old battery as defective for replacement.</p>

  <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Outlet verified and tested with a known device</li>
    <li>Power cord checked for damage</li>
    <li>Battery type and installation verified</li>
    <li>Charging indicator behavior</li>
    <li>Any error codes or alarms</li>
    <li>Final ventilator status after testing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>Power failures in ventilators like the Hamilton MR1 are often caused by simple, external factors such as drained batteries or poor connections. Logical, stepwise troubleshooting ensures patient safety and avoids unnecessary internal repairs. Accurate documentation in CCR format preserves the history of the issue for future reference.</p>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
