  <p>Alarm Failures / False Alarms</p>
</section>

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Anesthesia Machine</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Dräger</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Fabius</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Fabius anesthesia machine emits alarms incorrectly, fails to alarm, or triggers false alarms. The focus is on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes first, such as sensor connections, power, setup, and environmental factors, before assuming internal system failures.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Verify Machine Power and Backup</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the machine is plugged into a verified working outlet and powered on.</li>
  <li>Check battery status if operating on internal battery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Low or unstable power can prevent alarm circuits from functioning correctly.</p>

<h4>Inspect Alarm and Sensor Connections</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify that all breathing circuits, O₂ sensors, pressure lines, and flow sensors are properly connected.</li>
  <li>Check that connectors are clean, dry, and free of damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: A loose or faulty sensor can trigger false alarms or prevent real alarms.</p>

<h4>Check Gas Supply and Flow</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm that O₂, N₂O, and air supply lines are connected and pressure is within normal operating range.</li>
  <li>Verify that flowmeters are not blocked or leaking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Incorrect gas pressures or flows can trigger high/low alarms erroneously.</p>

<h4>Examine Breathing Circuit Setup</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure correct circuit type (adult, pediatric) is selected in the machine settings.</li>
  <li>Check for leaks or obstructions in the circuit and endotracheal tube connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Circuit misconfiguration can generate pressure or volume alarms.</p>

<h4>Confirm Alarm Configuration and Limits</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Review the alarm limits set in the machine for O₂, CO₂, airway pressure, tidal volume, etc.</li>
  <li>Ensure that alarm mute buttons are not inadvertently engaged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Overly tight or loose alarm limits can cause repeated false alarms or missed alarms.</p>

<h4>Perform a Self-Test / System Check</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Run the machine’s built-in self-test (Dräger Fabius includes an automated check).</li>
  <li>Observe any errors or warnings reported.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: The self-test can detect internal sensor issues or software faults affecting alarms.</p>

<h4>Environmental Factors</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the machine is not exposed to extreme temperatures, moisture, or electrical interference.</li>
  <li>Remove any nearby equipment that could interfere with sensors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Environmental conditions can trigger spurious alarms.</p>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>External checks and proper setup have been verified. The issue may be due to internal electronics, sensor modules, or software corruption.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the machine from service.</li>
  <li>Label as Out of Service (OOS).</li>
  <li>Send to Dräger-certified repair or Clinical Engineering bench evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reminder: Knowing when to escalate is proper troubleshooting and ensures patient safety.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never troubleshoot alarms while the machine is in use with a patient. Transfer the patient to another machine before testing. Verify patient safety first—false alarms can mask true critical events.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“User reports frequent false alarms and occasional alarm failures on the Fabius machine.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Upon inspection, some sensor connectors were loose, and alarm limits were improperly set.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Reconnected sensors securely, verified all connections, reset alarm limits, ran self-test, and confirmed alarms functioning correctly.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested: Yes/No</li>
  <li>Sensor connections checked: Yes/No</li>
  <li>Alarm configuration verified: Yes/No</li>
  <li>Self-test completed: Yes/No</li>
  <li>Any unusual sounds or smells: Describe</li>
  <li>Final device status: Operational / OOS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Patient safety is the top priority. Logical, stepwise troubleshooting reduces unnecessary downtime, identifies true causes, and ensures alarms function correctly. Document every step using CCR methodology for compliance and accountability.</p>
<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
