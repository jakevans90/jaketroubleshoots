<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Sequential Compression Device (SCD)</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Cardinal Health</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Kendall SCD 700 Series</p>

<h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a Kendall SCD 700 Series delivers compression pressure that appears:</p>

<ul>
<li>Too low</li>
<li>Weak during inflation</li>
<li>Inconsistent between cycles</li>
<li>Uneven between left and right legs</li>
</ul>

<p>The focus is on logical, external, and easily verifiable causes before assuming internal pump, valve, or pressure sensor failure.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>1. Confirm Therapy Mode and Active Cycle</h4>
<ul>
<li>Verify correct therapy mode (calf vs. thigh).</li>
<li>Confirm therapy is actively running and not paused or in standby.</li>
<li>Observe at least one full inflation/deflation cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Incorrect mode selection or incomplete startup can mimic low-pressure delivery.</em></p>

<h4>2. Check Sleeve Application and Fit</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ensure sleeves are wrapped snugly and evenly.</li>
<li>Confirm proper sleeve size for the patient.</li>
<li>Verify hook-and-loop closures are fully secured.</li>
<li>Check that bladders are aligned correctly with the limb.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Oversized or loosely applied sleeves often feel like low pressure even when the unit is functioning properly.</em></p>

<h4>3. Inspect Tubing for Leaks or Obstructions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Examine entire tubing length for cracks, splits, or pinholes.</li>
<li>Check for loose fittings at both ends.</li>
<li>Look for kinks, sharp bends, or compression under bed rails or equipment.</li>
<li>Inspect for partially disconnected quick-connect fittings.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Even a small air leak significantly reduces delivered compression pressure.</em></p>

<h4>4. Reseat All Connections at the Ports</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fully disconnect and reconnect tubing at both device ports.</li>
<li>Ensure connectors click or seat completely.</li>
<li>Listen for escaping air during inflation.</li>
<li>Gently move connectors while the unit is inflating to check for intermittent leaks.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Partially seated connectors are a common cause of inconsistent pressure.</em></p>

<h4>5. Swap Sleeves and Tubing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Swap left and right sleeves.</li>
<li>Replace tubing with a known-good set if available.</li>
<li>Observe results:</li>
<li>If the issue follows the sleeve → sleeve likely leaking.</li>
<li>If the issue follows the tubing → tubing defective.</li>
<li>If the issue remains on the same device port → possible internal valve or channel issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This step helps isolate accessory failure from internal device failure.</em></p>

<h4>6. Listen to Pump Operation</h4>
<ul>
<li>During inflation:</li>
<li>Pump sound should be smooth and consistent.</li>
<li>No excessive strain, grinding, or rapid short cycling.</li>
<li>No unusually loud or weak-sounding motor activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Rapid cycling without building pressure often indicates a leak or internal valve malfunction.</em></p>

<h4>7. Check for Alarms or Error Messages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Look for:</li>
<li>Leak detected</li>
<li>Pressure fault</li>
<li>System error</li>
<li>Record the exact alarm wording for documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>8. Compare Both Channels</h4>
<ul>
<li>Swap tubing between ports.</li>
<li>Observe whether low pressure follows the tubing or remains with the device port.</li>
<li>If the issue remains isolated to one port after accessory swaps, internal channel components are likely involved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If the Problem Persists</h3>
<p>If pressure remains low or inconsistent after completing these steps, common remaining causes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Internal pump wear</li>
<li>Valve manifold failure</li>
<li>Pressure sensor drift</li>
<li>Internal air leak</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not field-correctable.</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the unit from clinical service</li>
<li>Label clearly as Out of Service</li>
<li>Send for repair or bench evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop bedside troubleshooting is proper Clinical Engineering practice.</p>

<h3>Clinical Use Tip</h3>
<p>Do not troubleshoot pressure concerns while sleeves are actively connected to a patient.</p>
<p>Transfer the patient to a functioning SCD unit first.</p>
<p>Verify DVT prophylaxis therapy continues uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Perform troubleshooting only when patient safety is ensured.</p>
<p>Never compromise active therapy to investigate equipment performance.</p>

<h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Compression pressure weak and inconsistent on left leg.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>“Sleeves and tubing inspected and swapped; issue remained on left port. Suspected internal valve or pump degradation.”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“Issue followed sleeve when swapped. Sleeve found leaking.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>“Replaced defective sleeve; unit returned to service.”</p>
<p>“Removed device from service and sent for bench evaluation due to suspected internal pressure channel failure.”</p>

<h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Side affected (left / right / both)</li>
<li>Exact alarm message wording</li>
<li>Sleeve size used</li>
<li>Sleeve swapped: yes / no</li>
<li>Tubing replaced: yes / no</li>
<li>Pump audible and consistent: yes / no</li>
<li>Leak heard at connections: yes / no</li>
<li>Final device status (returned to service / sent to repair)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thought</h3>
<p>Most low-pressure complaints are caused by loose connections, accessory leaks, incorrect sleeve sizing, or incomplete setup — not internal pump failure.</p>

<p>A logical, step-by-step approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Protects patient therapy</li>
<li>Prevents unnecessary device replacement</li>
<li>Ensures accurate documentation</li>
<li>Identifies true internal failures when present</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
