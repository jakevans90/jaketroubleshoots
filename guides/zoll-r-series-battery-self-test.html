  <h2>ZOLL R Series Defibrillator</h2>
  <p>Battery Issue – Fails Self-Test</p>
</section>

<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Defibrillator</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>ZOLL</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>R Series</p>

<h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a ZOLL R Series defibrillator reports that the battery has failed its self-test.</p>

<p>The focus is on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes before assuming battery pack failure. These steps prioritize patient safety and proper escalation without unnecessary disassembly or advanced repair.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>1. Ensure the Device Is Not in Active Clinical Use</h4>
<ul>
<li>Before troubleshooting, confirm the defibrillator is not connected to a patient.</li>
<li>If the unit is needed for care:</li>
<li>Replace it immediately with a known-good device.</li>
<li>Remove the affected unit from the crash cart.</li>
<li>Self-test and battery troubleshooting should never be performed on an active emergency device.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Verify the Battery Is Fully Seated</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove the battery from the rear compartment.</li>
<li>Inspect the latch mechanism and guide rails.</li>
<li>Reinstall the battery firmly until it clicks and locks into place.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why this matters: A partially seated battery can interrupt power continuity and trigger a self-test failure even if the battery itself is functional.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Power the unit on and allow the self-test to complete.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Inspect Battery and Device Contacts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Visually inspect:</li>
<li>Battery terminals</li>
<li>Device-side contact pins</li>
<li>Signs of debris, corrosion, discoloration, or bent contacts</li>
<li>If debris is present, clean using an approved method per department policy.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why this matters: Poor electrical contact can cause charging faults, communication errors, or false self-test failure messages.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Reinstall the battery and repeat the self-test.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Verify Charging Status</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the defibrillator is stored connected to AC power per department policy.</li>
<li>Check for:</li>
<li>Charging indicator lights</li>
<li>Docking station power (if applicable)</li>
<li>Verified AC outlet functionality</li>
<li>If needed, allow the battery to charge for an appropriate period and then repeat the self-test.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why this matters: Low capacity or deep discharge conditions can trigger battery failure messages even when the battery is not permanently defective.</em></p>

<h4>5. Test With a Known-Good Battery (If Available)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove the suspect battery.</li>
<li>Install a known-good battery from another ZOLL R Series unit.</li>
<li>Allow the self-test to complete.</li>
<li>Interpretation:</li>
<li>If the alternate battery passes → Likely failed battery pack</li>
<li>If the alternate battery also fails → Possible device-side power management issue</li>
<li>This step isolates whether the problem follows the battery or remains with the device.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Document the Exact Self-Test Message</h4>
<ul>
<li>Record the exact wording displayed:</li>
<li>“Battery Fail”</li>
<li>“Replace Battery”</li>
<li>Immediate failure vs failure after charge cycle</li>
<li>Small differences in wording may indicate:</li>
<li>Capacity failure</li>
<li>Communication error</li>
<li>Charging fault</li>
<li>Precise documentation improves repair accuracy and vendor communication if escalation is required.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If the Problem Persists</h3>
<p>If the battery continues to fail self-test after:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reseating</li>
<li>Contact inspection</li>
<li>Charging verification</li>
<li>Known-good battery testing</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is likely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal to the battery pack</li>
<li>or</li>
<li>Internal to the defibrillator power management system (if multiple batteries fail)</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the affected battery or device from service</li>
<li>Clearly label it Out of Service</li>
<li>Send for evaluation or replacement per department protocol</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting. Continuing beyond external checks risks unsafe equipment returning to service.</p>

<h3>Clinical Use Tip</h3>
<p>A defibrillator battery that fails self-test should never remain on an emergency crash cart.</p>
<p>Always replace the battery or the entire device before returning it to a clinical area. A battery may power on initially but fail under therapy load during an actual code.</p>
<p>Patient safety comes first.</p>

<h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
“Unit reports battery failed self-test during daily check.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was determined during troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Examples:<br>
“Battery fails self-test after reseating and charging. Known-good battery passes. Suspected failed battery pack.”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“Multiple batteries fail in same unit. Suspected internal device power issue.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p>Examples:<br>
“Removed battery from service and replaced with known-good battery.”</p>
<p>“Tagged battery Out of Service and sent for evaluation.”</p>
<p>“Removed device from service pending bench evaluation.”</p>

<h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Battery reseated: yes / no</li>
<li>Contacts inspected: yes / no</li>
<li>AC outlet verified: yes / no</li>
<li>Alternate battery tested: yes / no</li>
<li>Exact self-test message</li>
<li>Any unusual heat, swelling, or odor</li>
<li>Final device status (returned to service or removed)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thought</h3>
<p>Defibrillator batteries are consumable components and will eventually fail. The built-in self-test system is designed to prevent unreliable performance during a life-saving event.</p>

<p>By following a logical, step-by-step approach, you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rule out simple external causes</li>
<li>Protect patient safety</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary internal repair</li>
<li>Provide clear and defensible documentation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
