    <h3>Asset Type</h3>
    <p>Pulse Oximeter</p>

    <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
    <p>Masimo</p>

    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>Rad-97 Pulse Oximeter</p>

    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses situations where the Masimo Rad-97 pulse oximeter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fails to power on</li>
      <li>Powers off unexpectedly</li>
      <li>Shows low battery warnings despite charging</li>
      <li>Experiences short battery life</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The focus is on external, easily verifiable causes first—such as battery condition, charger, and connections—before assuming internal battery or board failure.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Verify Battery Charge and Connections</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the device is connected to the approved charger.</li>
      <li>Check that the charging contacts on both the battery and device are clean, free of debris, and aligned.</li>
      <li>Observe the charging indicator LED: solid or blinking light per Masimo specifications indicates charging status.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Dirty or misaligned contacts can prevent proper charging, mimicking battery failure.</p>

    <h4>Test With a Known Good Power Source</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Plug the charger into a verified working outlet.</li>
      <li>Avoid power strips with switches or surge protectors that might interrupt current.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Eliminates external power issues before assuming battery failure.</p>

    <h4>Remove and Reinstall the Battery</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Power down the device if possible.</li>
      <li>Remove the battery, inspect for corrosion, swelling, or damage.</li>
      <li>Reinsert securely and attempt to power on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Sometimes battery reseating resolves poor contact or software detection errors.</p>

    <h4>Try a Known Good Battery</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If available, replace the battery with a fully charged, verified working battery.</li>
      <li>Power on the device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Confirms whether the original battery is at fault without opening the device.</p>

    <h4>Check for Firmware or Device Alerts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Some Rad-97 units may display battery or power warnings in the interface.</li>
      <li>Note any codes or messages for documentation and potential escalation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Internal battery management alerts can help determine if the issue is software or hardware related.</p>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>External causes (power source, charging contacts, battery seating) have been ruled out.</p>
    <p>Device should be removed from service, labeled Out of Service, and sent for repair or bench evaluation.</p>
    <p>Stopping at this stage is proper troubleshooting and avoids patient risk.</p>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <p>Do not troubleshoot on an actively monitored patient. Move the patient to a backup pulse oximeter first.</p>
    <p>Only perform troubleshooting in a safe, controlled environment.</p>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Rad-97 would not power on; patient monitoring interrupted.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Battery failed to hold charge; charger and power source verified.”</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    “Device removed from service, labeled Out of Service, sent to Biomedical Engineering for battery replacement and functional testing.”</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Battery type and age</li>
      <li>Charger model used</li>
      <li>LED charging indicator behavior</li>
      <li>Any unusual noises, smells, or heat from battery</li>
      <li>Device behavior when using a replacement battery</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Power and battery issues are commonly caused by easily fixed external factors like charger, outlet, or battery contacts. Proper troubleshooting avoids unnecessary internal disassembly, protects patient safety, and ensures accurate documentation for follow-up repair.</p>
    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
