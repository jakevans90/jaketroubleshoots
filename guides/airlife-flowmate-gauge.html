  <h2>Airlife FlowMate Oxygen Flowmeter</h2>
  <p>Gauge / Meter Malfunction</p>
</section>

<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Oxygen Flowmeter</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Airlife</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>FlowMate</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the AirLife FlowMate oxygen flowmeter:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displays an inaccurate flow reading</li>
  <li>Shows erratic needle movement or jumps</li>
  <li>Fails to register flow at all</li>
  <li>Feels stuck or mechanically resistant</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus is on external, easily verifiable causes first, before assuming internal meter failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Verify the Gas Source</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the oxygen cylinder or pipeline supply is turned on.</li>
  <li>Confirm that the supply pressure is within the recommended range for the FlowMate (typically 50–60 psi).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why:</em> Low or fluctuating supply pressure can cause inaccurate readings.</p>

<h4>Inspect the Connection</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check that the flowmeter is fully seated on the regulator or manifold.</li>
  <li>Examine inlet threads for damage or debris.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why:</em> Loose or contaminated connections can impede proper needle movement.</p>

<h4>Check for Obstructions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove tubing from the outlet and visually inspect the flow path.</li>
  <li>Look for kinks, moisture, or particulate matter in the tubing.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why:</em> Blockages can falsely increase back pressure, affecting gauge readings.</p>

<h4>Test with Another Flowmeter</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If available, attach a known-good flowmeter to the same source.</li>
  <li>Compare readings at identical settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why:</em> Confirms whether the issue is with the flowmeter or the supply.</p>

<h4>Environmental Factors</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the device is not exposed to extreme vibration, tilt, or temperature fluctuations.</li>
  <li>The FlowMate should remain upright on a stable surface.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why:</em> Tilted or unstable placement can cause mechanical meters to misread.</p>

<h4>Check for Visible Damage</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Inspect the gauge face, needle, and housing for cracks, dents, or internal moisture.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why:</em> Physical damage often results in mechanical binding or incorrect readings.</p>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>Common external causes have been ruled out; the internal mechanism is likely faulty.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the FlowMate from service.</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service.</li>
  <li>Send for repair or bench evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Recognizing when to stop troubleshooting protects patient safety and prevents further damage.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not attempt to use a malfunctioning flowmeter on a patient.</li>
  <li>Switch the patient to another verified oxygen delivery device immediately.</li>
  <li>Only troubleshoot flowmeter function away from active patient care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Flowmeter needle jumps and reads inaccurately at all settings.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
Upon inspection, supply pressure and connections were normal; tubing clear; device tested on stable surface; meter still inaccurate.</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
Flowmeter removed from service, labeled Out of Service, sent for repair.</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Supply source and pressure checked</li>
  <li>Tubing and connections inspected</li>
  <li>Device tested upright and stable</li>
  <li>Comparison flowmeter reading (if available)</li>
  <li>Any visible damage or moisture inside gauge</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Patient safety depends on reliable oxygen delivery. Logical, stepwise troubleshooting ensures external factors are addressed first, while knowing when to escalate prevents risk to patients and preserves device integrity. Proper CCR documentation supports clear communication and compliance.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
