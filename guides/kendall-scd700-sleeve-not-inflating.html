<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Sequential Compression Device (SCD)</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Cardinal Health</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Kendall SCD 700 Series</p>

<h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>

<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when one or more sleeves connected to a Kendall SCD 700 Series unit are not inflating properly.</p>

<p>Common symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
<li>One leg inflates but the other does not</li>
<li>Both sleeves connected but neither inflates</li>
<li>Partial inflation or weak compression</li>
<li>Machine running but no pressure delivered</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide focuses on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes before assuming internal pump or valve failure.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>Confirm the Unit Is Powered and Therapy Is Started</h4>
<ul>
<li>Verify the unit is powered on.</li>
<li>Confirm there are no active alarms preventing therapy.</li>
<li>Ensure therapy has been started (unit powered on alone does not initiate compression).</li>
</ul>
<p>A common oversight is the device being powered but not actively running therapy.</p>

<h4>Check Sleeve and Tubing Connections</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm tubing is fully seated into the correct port.</li>
<li>Push connectors firmly until fully engaged.</li>
<li>Inspect for partially disconnected or loose fittings.</li>
<li>Swap left and right ports to see if the issue follows the sleeve or remains with the port.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loose or partially seated connectors are the most common cause of one sleeve not inflating.</p>

<h4>Inspect the Tubing for Kinks or Damage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Follow the entire tubing length from unit to sleeve.</li>
<li>Check for sharp bends or kinks.</li>
<li>Ensure tubing is not pinched under bed rails, wheels, or mattress frames.</li>
<li>Inspect for cracks, punctures, or separation at connection points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even a small leak will prevent the system from building pressure.</p>

<h4>Inspect the Sleeves</h4>
<p>Visually inspect for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tears or punctures</li>
<li>Separated seams</li>
<li>Worn or ineffective Velcro</li>
<li>Improper wrapping</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure sleeves are wrapped snugly but not overly tight. Improper fit can prevent pressure buildup or cause uneven compression.</p>

<h4>Swap Sleeves to Isolate the Issue</h4>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect both sleeves.</li>
<li>Connect the left sleeve to the right port and vice versa.</li>
<li>Restart therapy and observe.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the issue follows the sleeve → the sleeve is likely defective.<br>
If the issue stays with the same port → suspect an internal valve or channel issue.</p>
<p>This step is critical for isolating accessory failure versus device failure.</p>

<h4>Check for Alarm Messages</h4>
<p>Document any alarm messages exactly as displayed, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leak detected</li>
<li>Disconnected tubing</li>
<li>Pressure fault</li>
</ul>
<p>Alarm wording helps determine whether the system is sensing a leak or failing to generate pressure.</p>

<h4>Listen for Pump Operation</h4>
<p>Start therapy and listen carefully:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pump audible and cycling → air movement is occurring.</li>
<li>Pump running but no inflation → possible internal valve or manifold issue.</li>
<li>No pump sound → possible internal motor or control board issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid opening the device. Internal repair is not a bedside procedure.</p>

<h4>If the Problem Persists</h4>
<p>If the sleeves still do not inflate after completing all external checks, you have ruled out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Therapy not started</li>
<li>Loose or disconnected tubing</li>
<li>Kinked or damaged tubing</li>
<li>Defective sleeves</li>
<li>Alarm-related interruptions</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is likely internal, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal valve failure</li>
<li>Pump motor malfunction</li>
<li>Pressure sensor fault</li>
<li>Internal manifold leak</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Remove the unit from service</li>
<li>Clearly label it “Out of Service”</li>
<li>Send for bench evaluation or repair</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop and escalate is proper troubleshooting.</p>

<h3>Clinical Use Tip</h3>

<p>Do not troubleshoot sleeve inflation while actively connected to a patient requiring therapy.</p>

<p>If compression therapy is clinically indicated:</p>

<ul>
<li>Move the patient to a functioning SCD unit first.</li>
<li>Then remove the suspected unit from service for evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Patient safety and uninterrupted therapy take priority over troubleshooting speed.</p>

<h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>

<p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>Example:<br>
“One sleeve not inflating; right leg receiving no compression.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>Examples:<br>
“Tubing and sleeve inspected. Swapped sleeves; issue followed right sleeve. Sleeve leaking.”<br>
or<br>
“Swapped sleeves and ports. Issue remained on left port. Suspected internal valve failure.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>Examples:<br>
“Replaced defective sleeve; unit tested and returned to service.”<br>
or<br>
“Removed device from service and sent to shop for internal repair.”</p>

<h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Which side affected (left/right/both)</li>
<li>Exact alarm messages displayed</li>
<li>Whether sleeves were swapped</li>
<li>Whether issue followed sleeve or stayed with port</li>
<li>Tubing condition (intact/kinked/damaged)</li>
<li>Pump audible (yes/no)</li>
<li>Final device status (returned to service or removed)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thought</h3>

<p>Most sleeve inflation problems are accessory-related rather than internal failures. Logical, external troubleshooting protects patients, prevents unnecessary equipment swaps, and supports accurate documentation. Escalate only after simple causes have been ruled out.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
