  <p>“Canister Full” or Level Sensor Errors</p>
</section>

<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Surgical Fluid Management System</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Stryker</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Neptune</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>

<p>This guide addresses situations where the Stryker Neptune displays a “Canister Full” message or generates level sensor–related errors even when the canister is not actually full.</p>

<p>These issues are commonly caused by float obstruction, improper canister seating, sensor misalignment, residual fluid contamination, or connection problems—not immediate internal board failure. This guide walks through logical external checks first before escalating.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the unit is not actively connected to a patient before beginning troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>If in use, transition suction to wall vacuum or a backup device before continuing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirm the Message and Current Setup</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify the exact alarm message on the display.</li>
  <li>Determine which canister position is generating the error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Identifying the affected canister prevents unnecessary removal of all containers and helps isolate the issue.</p>

<h4>Inspect the Canister Fluid Level</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Visually confirm the fluid level.</li>
  <li>If full or near full, properly dispose of contents per facility policy and replace with an empty canister.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: The simplest cause of a “Canister Full” message is an actually full container.</p>

<h4>Remove and Re-seat the Canister</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the affected canister.</li>
  <li>Inspect the bottom and rear connection points.</li>
  <li>Reinstall firmly, ensuring it is fully seated and locked in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Improper seating can prevent proper engagement of the level sensor mechanism and trigger false alarms.</p>

<h4>Inspect the Float Mechanism</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check the internal float assembly inside the canister.</li>
  <li>Ensure the float moves freely and is not stuck in the “up” position.</li>
  <li>Look for coagulated debris or thick fluids restricting movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: A stuck float will continuously signal “full” even when the canister is empty.</p>

<h4>Inspect Sensor Contact Area</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Examine the sensor interface area on the unit where the canister docks.</li>
  <li>Look for dried fluid, residue, or corrosion.</li>
  <li>Clean the external sensor contact area with approved disinfectant wipes (do not saturate).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Fluid intrusion or contamination at the sensor interface can create false level readings.</p>

<h4>Swap Canisters Between Positions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Move the suspected canister to another port (if applicable).</li>
  <li>Install a known-good canister in the original port.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the problem follows the canister → the canister is defective.</li>
  <li>If the problem stays with the port → the issue may be sensor-related within the unit.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Power Cycle the Unit</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Turn the Neptune off.</li>
  <li>Wait 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Restart and allow the system to complete self-test.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Temporary sensor logic faults can clear during reboot.</p>

<h4>Check for Signs of Fluid Intrusion</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Look for moisture, staining, or unusual odor near the canister ports.</li>
  <li>Check for alarm recurrence immediately after startup.</li>
  <li>If fluid intrusion into the internal sensor housing is suspected, do not continue operating the unit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>

<p>If:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple known-good canisters trigger the same error</li>
  <li>The error remains in the same port after swapping</li>
  <li>The float mechanism moves freely</li>
  <li>The sensor interface is clean</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the issue is likely internal (sensor failure, wiring issue, or control board fault).</p>

<p>At this point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the device from service</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service</li>
  <li>Send to the shop for controlled bench evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop external troubleshooting and escalate is proper Clinical Engineering practice.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>

<p>Never troubleshoot canister or level sensor errors while the system is actively connected to a surgical field.</p>

<p>If the alarm occurs during a procedure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transition suction to wall vacuum or backup device immediately.</li>
  <li>Once patient safety is secured, remove the Neptune from service for evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Patient safety always overrides troubleshooting speed.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Unit displaying ‘Canister Full’ alarm immediately after new empty canister installed.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Level sensor falsely detecting full condition in port #2. Float mechanism moved freely. Error remained with port after canister swap.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Removed unit from service. Labeled Out of Service. Sent to shop for sensor evaluation and repair. Backup unit provided to OR.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Which port was affected</li>
  <li>Whether canisters were swapped</li>
  <li>Condition of float mechanism</li>
  <li>Evidence of fluid residue at sensor interface</li>
  <li>Whether alarm cleared after power cycle</li>
  <li>Final device status (Returned to service or Sent for repair)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>

<p>Level sensor alarms are often simple mechanical or contamination issues rather than immediate electronic failure. Start with the canister, float, and seating. Confirm with logical swaps. Escalate appropriately when the fault follows the port rather than the container.</p>

<p>Structured troubleshooting protects patients, reduces downtime, and prevents unnecessary part replacement.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
