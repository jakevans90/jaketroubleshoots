    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>Kangaroo ePump</p>

    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses situations where the Kangaroo ePump touchscreen or keypad:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does not respond to user input</li>
      <li>Responds intermittently or erratically</li>
      <li>Registers incorrect selections or “ghost” inputs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The focus is on external, easily verifiable causes first—such as power, connections, and contamination—before assuming internal electronics failure.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Verify Power Source</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the pump is properly plugged into a verified working outlet or fully charged battery.</li>
      <li>A weak or fluctuating power source can cause unresponsive or erratic keypad/touchscreen behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inspect for Physical Obstructions or Contamination</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the screen and keypad for moisture, dirt, or residue.</li>
      <li>Clean gently with a lint-free cloth and approved cleaning solution.</li>
      <li>Liquid spills or excessive debris can block touch response.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check Protective Covers or Cases</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If the pump has a protective silicone or plastic overlay, remove it and test the keypad.</li>
      <li>Some covers can interfere with proper touch registration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Perform a Soft Reset</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn the pump off, wait 10–15 seconds, then turn it back on.</li>
      <li>This can reset the touchscreen controller and clear minor software glitches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Test All Buttons and Touch Areas</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Press each button and touch multiple areas of the screen.</li>
      <li>Confirm if the unresponsiveness is localized or affects the entire keypad.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inspect Connectors and Cables</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the ribbon cable or connector between the keypad/touchscreen and main board (if accessible externally).</li>
      <li>Ensure it is seated properly and not damaged.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>External causes have been ruled out, and the issue is likely internal electronics or touchscreen controller failure.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the device from service</li>
      <li>Label as Out of Service</li>
      <li>Send for manufacturer repair or internal bench evaluation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Knowing when to escalate is proper troubleshooting and ensures patient safety.</p>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Never attempt to troubleshoot on a patient actively receiving feeding.</li>
      <li>Switch the patient to a backup pump or alternative feeding method before troubleshooting.</li>
      <li>Ensure all device manipulations are done in a safe environment to avoid accidental infusion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Pump touchscreen not responding, unable to start feeding.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Screen unresponsive after inspection; no visible damage or contamination; soft reset did not restore function.”</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    “Pump removed from service, labeled Out of Service, sent for manufacturer evaluation.”</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify if the issue occurs on battery or AC power</li>
      <li>Note any screen flickering or ghost inputs</li>
      <li>Record if protective overlays were present</li>
      <li>Document if soft reset temporarily restored partial functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Patient safety and proper device function are paramount. Use logical troubleshooting steps, check external factors first, and escalate appropriately. Clear documentation ensures continuity of care and compliance with hospital procedures.</p>
    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
