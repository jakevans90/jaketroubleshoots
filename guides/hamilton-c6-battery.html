    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses a HAMILTON‑C6 ventilator whose battery appears not to hold a charge — for example, the unit drops charge quickly, won’t show full charge, or only runs a short time on battery power. It focuses on clinical engineering–oriented checks starting with power and battery basics before assuming internal battery failure.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Safety First – Patient Not on Battery</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the ventilated patient is on mains power or an alternative power source. Do not rely on a low or questionable battery during active ventilation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Verify Primary Power Connection</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirm the ventilator is plugged into a properly grounded, hospital‑grade receptacle.</li>
      <li>Make sure the AC mains power is present at the outlet (use a known good outlet tester).</li>
      <li>Inspect the power cord and connector for damage or loose contacts.</li>
      <li><strong>Why:</strong> The ventilator only charges its batteries when connected to primary AC power. No mains means no charging regardless of battery condition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check Ambient Conditions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the ventilator and battery are not being charged at temperatures &gt;43 °C (e.g., near heat sources or in direct sunlight). High temperature can prevent charging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Install and Seat Battery Correctly</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove and re‑install the battery to verify it is properly seated and the lock is fully engaged.</li>
      <li>Inspect battery contacts for debris or corrosion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Observe Battery Indicators</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Review the battery charge indicator on the ventilator display.</li>
      <li>If the battery reads empty or does not register, check for any Battery communication error alarms; these may indicate poor connection or failed battery detection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Swap With Known Good Battery</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If a second battery is available, swap it in and test whether it charges and holds charge.</li>
      <li>If the spare battery behaves normally, the original battery may have degraded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Battery Calibration/Service Hint</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Some designs internally calibrate battery capacity over multiple charge/discharge cycles; if the battery has not been used or calibrated in a long time, run a few controlled cycles (connect to mains, allow full charge, disconnect, allow full discharge) with service oversight.</li>
      <li>Refer to manufacturer for recommended calibration/test intervals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>If proper power, temperature, connections, and seating have been confirmed and batteries still won’t charge or hold charge despite using a known good battery, the issue is likely internal to the battery pack or battery management circuitry.</p>
    <p>Internal battery pack failure or end‑of‑life is the most common cause of rapid charge loss in lithium‑ion battery systems — these cells degrade with age/cycles and lose capacity. The ventilator may reject weak batteries.</p>
    <p>Next Steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the ventilator from portable battery use.</li>
      <li>Label the unit as Out of Service for Battery Failure.</li>
      <li>Send the unit (or just the battery packs) for bench evaluation or replacement per manufacturer recommendation.</li>
      <li>Contact the local Hamilton Medical service representative or authorized repair center to procure replacement batteries and confirm proper service procedures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <p>Always ensure that any battery‑related troubleshooting or battery replacement is done with the ventilator disconnected from patient use or with the patient on a reliable alternate power source to avoid unexpected ventilation interruption.</p>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Unit displays poor battery charge retention, depletes quickly, and will not hold charge.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    Verified AC power present; battery does not indicate full charge; spare battery also fails; charging does not appear to progress; ambient conditions within normal range.</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    Removed battery from service; unit labeled Out of Service; vendor notified for battery replacement; scheduled for bench evaluation.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Battery charge behavior over time</li>
      <li>Indicators and alarms</li>
      <li>Power cord and outlet condition</li>
      <li>Ambient temperature during charging</li>
      <li>Final device status after battery removal</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Battery systems on critical care ventilators are designed primarily as backup power — they are not intended for prolonged mains disconnection and will degrade over time. Systematic checks that isolate power, environment, and simple connections can prevent unnecessary internal repairs. Knowing when to escalate battery replacement helps maintain patient safety and device reliability.</p>
    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
