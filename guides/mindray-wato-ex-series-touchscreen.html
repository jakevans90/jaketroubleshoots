    <h3>Asset Type</h3>
    <p>Anesthesia Machine</p>

    <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
    <p>Mindray</p>

    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>WATO EX Series</p>

    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses situations where the WATO EX Series anesthesia machine:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does not respond to touchscreen input</li>
      <li>Shows intermittent or erratic UI behavior</li>
      <li>Freezes or displays unregistered commands</li>
      <li>Exhibits delayed or lagging response to user input</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Focus is on external, easily verifiable causes first—such as power, connections, and environmental factors—before considering internal electronics.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Verify Power Source</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the machine is properly plugged into a grounded outlet.</li>
      <li>Check the main power switch and any secondary power buttons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Why:</em> Fluctuating or insufficient power can cause touchscreen malfunctions.</p>

    <h4>Inspect Cables and Connections</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Check all external connections, including USB or auxiliary interfaces, for loose or damaged cables.</li>
      <li>Disconnect unnecessary peripherals to isolate the issue.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Why:</em> Faulty connections can interfere with the touchscreen interface.</p>

    <h4>Check for Contamination or Obstructions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspect the touchscreen for dirt, liquids, or residue that may prevent proper touch response.</li>
      <li>Clean gently with manufacturer-approved wipes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Why:</em> Surface contaminants can block capacitive or resistive touch sensors.</p>

    <h4>Restart the Machine</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform a controlled shutdown and restart.</li>
      <li>Observe whether the touchscreen responds after booting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Why:</em> Software glitches can often be resolved with a simple reboot.</p>

    <h4>Verify Environmental Conditions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure room temperature and humidity are within operational specifications.</li>
      <li>Avoid direct sunlight or strong electromagnetic interference near the touchscreen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Why:</em> Extreme conditions can degrade touchscreen sensitivity.</p>

    <h4>Check Software Version and Updates</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify that the device is running the latest software/firmware version.</li>
      <li>Apply updates according to Mindray procedures if accessible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Why:</em> Older firmware can lead to UI instability or unresponsiveness.</p>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>External causes have been ruled out. The touchscreen hardware or internal control board may be faulty.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the machine from service.</li>
      <li>Label it “Out of Service.”</li>
      <li>Send for repair or bench evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Knowing when to stop is a key part of proper troubleshooting and ensures patient safety.</p>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Never troubleshoot the touchscreen while a patient is actively on the machine.</li>
      <li>Move the patient to a backup anesthesia device before performing any troubleshooting.</li>
      <li>Always confirm alarms and patient monitoring are functional on an alternative device first.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Touchscreen intermittently unresponsive and lagging during use.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    Observed touchscreen unresponsive after verifying power, connections, and environmental conditions. No visible damage or contamination.</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    Restarted the machine; issue persisted. Device removed from service and sent to repair.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Power outlet tested and verified</li>
      <li>All cables and peripherals disconnected and reconnected</li>
      <li>Machine rebooted multiple times</li>
      <li>Environmental conditions checked</li>
      <li>Observed touchscreen behavior (freeze, lag, erratic response)</li>
      <li>Final device status: Out of service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Clinical Engineering troubleshooting relies on logical, stepwise evaluation, focusing first on simple, verifiable external factors. Escalation to repair is not a failure—it protects patient safety and preserves device integrity. Proper CCR documentation ensures traceability and supports future troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
