</section>

<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Bladder Scanner</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Verathon</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Prime Plus</p>

<h4>Ensure Patient Is Safe & Device Is Not In Use</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the scanner is in active use on a patient, finish the exam safely or switch to a standby device before troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify External Power Source</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If connected to AC power, confirm the outlet has power using a known working device or outlet tester.</li>
  <li>Inspect the power adapter for correct model, visible damage, frayed wires, bent pins, or debris.</li>
  <li>Ensure the adapter is fully seated in both the device and the wall outlet/UPS/power strip.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Battery and Battery Contacts</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If operating on battery, remove the battery module and inspect contacts for corrosion, dirt, or misalignment.</li>
  <li>Reinsert the battery making sure it locks into place.</li>
  <li>If a spare battery is available, try swapping to determine if the battery is the cause.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Examine Power Button & Physical Interface</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Press and hold the power button a few seconds. Confirm the button isn’t stuck or physically damaged.</li>
  <li>Observe any LED indicators or display backlight activity when pressing power.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Look for Power Indicator Behavior</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If lights flicker briefly or the screen attempts to light then shuts down, this may suggest insufficient power from either the battery or adapter.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Test With Minimal Connections</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove any unnecessary peripherals (printers, carts with other equipment, docking stations) and try powering on with just the essential power connection.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Observe for Overheating or Unusual Symptoms</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Feel for excessive heat at the power supply, battery, or scanner casing.</li>
  <li>Listen for unusual sounds (buzzing, fan noise) that could indicate internal issues.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Basic Reset (If Applicable)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Some devices have a reset function (consult quick start/reference sheet only — do not open the device). Perform a reset if documented and external.</li>
</ul>

<h4>If the Problem Persists</h4>
<ul>
  <li>After completing the above external checks (power source, battery, cables, power switch, basic reset), internal causes remain likely. At this point:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the device from clinical service.</li>
    <li>Label the device Out of Service.</li>
    <li>Send for manufacturer service or internal bench evaluation.</li>
    <li>Do not attempt internal board repairs or disassembly beyond what the user manual specifies for battery and cables.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Clinical Use Tip</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do not troubleshoot electrical or power issues while the scanner is on an active patient. If it fails during an exam, quickly transition to a known working bladder scanner to avoid clinical delays. Always ensure proper fall prevention if the scanner is on a mobile cart.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Complaint:</strong> “Bladder scanner fails to power on or shuts off shortly after powering.”</li>
  <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Observed no power at outlet with tester; power adapter barrel connection loose; battery contacts showed corrosion; device attempt to start but immediately loses power.</li>
  <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Verified outlet with tester; replaced power adapter with known good unit; cleaned battery contacts; confirmed device powers on and remains stable. End user tested functionality and confirmed normal operation. (If the device still fails, note that it was taken out of service and refer to manufacturer service in the resolution.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Helpful Details to Include</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested and outcome</li>
  <li>Power adapter model and whether swapped</li>
  <li>Battery ID and test results</li>
  <li>LED or display behavior during power attempts</li>
  <li>Any signs of physical damage, unusual heat, or sounds</li>
  <li>Final device status (Operational, OOS)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Final Thought</h4>
<p>This structured approach ensures patient safety, rules out common external causes first, and uses clear documentation for work orders and eventual escalation. Proper troubleshooting avoids unnecessary downtime and supports effective device management.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
