  <main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">
    <h3>Asset Type</h3>
    <p>Bladder Scanner</p>

    <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
    <p>Verathon</p>

    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>Prime Plus</p>

    <h4>Check Battery and Power Status</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the device is fully charged or connected to power. Low battery can affect probe signal processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Verify Probe and Cable Connection</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspect the ultrasound probe for secure connection to the scanner.</li>
      <li>Look for visible damage to the probe cable or connector.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inspect Probe Surface</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Check for cracks, debris, or dried gel on the probe face.</li>
      <li>Clean gently with approved disinfectant wipes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Confirm Correct Patient Positioning</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Patient should be supine, bladder midline, legs slightly bent.</li>
      <li>Inaccurate readings often occur if patient is leaning or moving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ensure Adequate Ultrasound Gel Application</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply sufficient gel to allow full contact between probe and skin.</li>
      <li>Air gaps reduce signal quality and volume accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check Device Settings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify correct gender selection (male/female) and patient type (adult/pediatric).</li>
      <li>Ensure the scanner mode is set to “Bladder Scan” and not other preset modes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Perform a Test Scan on a Known Volume Phantom (if available)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirms the scanner and probe are reading correctly outside of patient variability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Repeat Scan Carefully</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform 2–3 consecutive scans, noting any variability.</li>
      <li>Small movements or probe angle changes can affect readings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>If the Problem Persists</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>External causes have been ruled out (positioning, gel, settings, probe condition).</li>
      <li>The device should be:
        <ul>
          <li>Removed from service</li>
          <li>Labeled Out of Service</li>
          <li>Sent for Verathon service or bench evaluation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Knowing when to stop scanning and escalate is part of proper troubleshooting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Clinical Use Tip</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not rely solely on inaccurate bladder volumes for clinical decision-making.</li>
      <li>If readings are questionable, confirm with catheterization or alternative imaging.</li>
      <li>Always ensure patient safety by stabilizing the patient and avoiding unnecessary scanning attempts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Complaint:</strong> Reported inaccurate bladder volume readings.<br>
      Example: “Scanner reads 150 mL when catheterization shows 300 mL.”</li>
      <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Observed misalignment of probe, insufficient gel, or device settings mismatch.<br>
      Example: “Probe was not centered on bladder; patient slightly rotated.”</li>
      <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Actions taken to correct: checked connections, cleaned probe, reapplied gel, repeated scan.<br>
      Example: “Scanner cleaned, settings verified, repeated scan with proper positioning; readings remained inconsistent, device removed from service and labeled OOS.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Helpful Details to Include</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Patient position during scan</li>
      <li>Gel type and amount applied</li>
      <li>Number of scan attempts and variability</li>
      <li>Probe and cable condition</li>
      <li>Device battery or power status</li>
      <li>Device software version</li>
      <li>Final device status (e.g., OOS, sent for service)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Accurate bladder volume measurement is essential for patient safety. Logical, stepwise troubleshooting avoids unnecessary device damage, ensures safe patient care, and documents actions clearly. When readings remain unreliable after external checks, timely escalation to repair preserves both patient safety and device integrity.</p>

    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
