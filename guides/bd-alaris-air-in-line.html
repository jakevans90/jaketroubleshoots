<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses repeated or unexpected air-in-line alarms on a BD Alaris infusion pump. It focuses on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes first—such as IV bag setup, tubing priming, cassette loading, and air sensor cleanliness—before assuming internal failure.</p>

<p>Air-in-line alarms are often setup-related. Logical troubleshooting can resolve most issues without unnecessary repair escalation.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>1. Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the pump is actively infusing, pause the infusion.</li>
<li>Move the patient to a backup pump if therapy cannot be safely interrupted.</li>
<li>Do not troubleshoot while medication is actively infusing unless clinically appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Inspect the IV Bag or Fluid Container</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the bag is not empty or nearly empty.</li>
<li>Ensure the spike is fully seated in the bag port.</li>
<li>Check for air entering through a loose connection.</li>
<li>Why this matters: Low fluid levels or loose spikes are common causes of air introduction.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Inspect the Tubing from Bag to Pump</h4>
<ul>
<li>Look for visible air bubbles in the tubing.</li>
<li>Check for loose luer connections.</li>
<li>Ensure there are no cracks in the tubing.</li>
<li>Verify all clamps are open and fluid is flowing freely.</li>
<li>If air is present:</li>
<li>Re-prime the tubing per facility protocol.</li>
<li>Replace the tubing if repeated bubbles appear.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Check the Pump Segment in the Mechanism</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open the pump door and inspect the cassette/administration set section.</li>
<li>Confirm tubing is fully seated in the channel.</li>
<li>Ensure the tubing is not twisted or misaligned over the air sensor.</li>
<li>Close the door firmly until it latches.</li>
<li>Why this matters: Misalignment over the ultrasonic air sensor can falsely trigger alarms.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Inspect the Air Sensor Area</h4>
<ul>
<li>Look for dried fluid, tape residue, or debris in the air detection area.</li>
<li>Clean the exterior sensor area with approved disinfectant (avoid excessive moisture).</li>
<li>Do not disassemble the pump.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Replace the Administration Set</h4>
<ul>
<li>If alarms continue:</li>
<li>Replace the entire IV set with a new one.</li>
<li>Fully prime the new tubing before loading.</li>
<li>This rules out micro-fractures or manufacturing defects in the tubing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>7. Test the Pump Off-Patient</h4>
<ul>
<li>Load a properly primed new set.</li>
<li>Run fluid into a test receptacle.</li>
<li>Observe for recurring air alarms.</li>
<li>If the alarm persists under controlled testing, the issue may be internal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If all external causes have been ruled out and the air-in-line alarm continues during controlled testing, the likely causes may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Faulty ultrasonic air-in-line sensor</li>
<li>Sensor calibration drift</li>
<li>Internal board-level issue</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the pump from service</li>
<li>Label it Out of Service</li>
<li>Send for bench evaluation or authorized repair</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never attempt to “clear alarms repeatedly” on an active patient without verifying the cause. Air-in-line alarms exist to prevent air embolism risk. Always ensure patient therapy is safely transferred before extended troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Nurse reports repeated air-in-line alarms during infusion despite full IV bag.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Visible air bubbles noted in tubing due to incomplete priming. Tubing replaced and properly primed. No further alarms observed during functional test.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Replaced administration set, re-primed line, verified proper seating in pump channel. Performed off-patient functional test. Pump returned to service.”<br><br>
“Removed from service. Tagged Out of Service and sent to shop for air sensor evaluation.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include in Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Was outlet tested (if using module system)?</li>
<li>Tubing replaced?</li>
<li>Alarm reproducible off-patient?</li>
<li>Sensor area cleaned?</li>
<li>Any visible air observed?</li>
<li>Final operational status</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Air-in-line alarms are frequently caused by setup or tubing issues—not pump failure. A structured approach protects the patient, avoids unnecessary repairs, and supports reliable documentation. When external causes are eliminated and alarms persist, escalation is the correct and professional decision.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
