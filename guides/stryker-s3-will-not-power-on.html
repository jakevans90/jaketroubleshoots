  <p>Bed Will Not Power On</p>

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Hospital Bed</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Stryker</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>S3</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Stryker S3 hospital bed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Will not power on</li>
  <li>Has no indicator lights</li>
  <li>Shows no response from side rail or footboard controls</li>
  <li>Appears completely dead</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus is on logical, external power checks first before assuming internal power supply or control board failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify no patient is at risk due to bed position.</li>
  <li>If the bed is in use, safely transfer the patient to another bed before troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>Ensure brakes are engaged and side rails are secure before transfer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1. Verify AC Power Source</h4>
<p>Confirm the bed is plugged directly into a known-good wall outlet.</p>
<p>Test the outlet with another device (lamp, meter, or outlet tester).</p>
<p>Avoid assuming the outlet is functional based on appearance alone.</p>
<p>Why this matters: A tripped breaker or dead outlet is more common than internal failure.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested</li>
  <li>No extension cords in use</li>
  <li>Hospital-grade receptacle verified</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Inspect the Power Cord</h4>
<p>Check the entire length of the cord for cuts, pinch points, or exposed wiring.</p>
<p>Ensure the cord is fully seated at the bed’s power inlet.</p>
<p>Confirm the cord was not damaged during transport or housekeeping.</p>
<p>If damage is observed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the bed from service.</li>
  <li>Do not energize a compromised cord.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Check for Battery Operation</h4>
<p>The S3 bed contains an internal battery backup.</p>
<p>Unplug the bed and attempt to power on using battery.</p>
<p>If the bed powers on via battery but not AC, suspect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Failed AC inlet</li>
  <li>Internal fuse</li>
  <li>Power supply issue</li>
</ul>
<p>If the bed does not power on with battery:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Battery may be fully discharged or failed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Battery indicator lights observed</li>
  <li>Charging status verified (if applicable)</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Inspect the Line Voltage Indicator (If Equipped)</h4>
<p>Some S3 configurations include indicator LEDs.</p>
<p>Observe for any LED activity when plugged in.</p>
<p>No lights at all may indicate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No incoming AC</li>
  <li>Blown internal fuse</li>
  <li>Failed power supply</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Perform a Basic Reset</h4>
<p>Unplug the bed from AC power.</p>
<p>Disconnect battery if accessible externally (do not disassemble).</p>
<p>Wait 60 seconds.</p>
<p>Reconnect AC power first, then battery.</p>
<p>Attempt power-up again.</p>
<p>Why this matters: Embedded controllers can occasionally latch and require a full reset.</p>

<h4>6. Inspect for Signs of Internal Electrical Failure</h4>
<p>Without opening the unit, check for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Burning smell</li>
  <li>Unusual heat from control box</li>
  <li>Visible fluid intrusion near electronics</li>
  <li>Evidence of prior repair attempts</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these are present:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove from service immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h4>7. Confirm Control Lockout Is Not Engaged</h4>
<p>Some user reports of “dead bed” are actually control lockouts.</p>
<p>Verify that side rail controls are not locked via nurse control panel.</p>
<p>Attempt operation from multiple control locations.</p>
<p>If functions operate from one panel but not another:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suspect local control board or wiring issue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If all external power checks have been verified and the bed still does not power on, common external causes have been ruled out.</p>
<p>The issue is likely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internal power supply failure</li>
  <li>Blown internal fuse</li>
  <li>Failed control board</li>
  <li>Battery pack failure</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the bed from service</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service</li>
  <li>Document findings</li>
  <li>Send to shop for controlled bench evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary exposure to live circuits and maintains patient safety.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never troubleshoot a powered bed while a patient is in it.</p>
<p>If the bed fails during patient use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Safely transfer the patient to another bed.</li>
  <li>Ensure side rails and brakes are secure before transfer.</li>
  <li>Troubleshoot only after the patient is safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loss of bed power can affect positioning and fall risk features.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Bed in Room 312 will not power on. No lights or movement from controls.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“No AC power detected at wall outlet. Breaker was tripped. Bed functional once connected to verified outlet.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Reset breaker, verified proper AC supply, confirmed bed powers on and all functions operate normally. Returned to service.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested: Yes/No</li>
  <li>Cord condition: Intact/Damaged</li>
  <li>Battery status: Charged/Dead</li>
  <li>Indicator lights present: Yes/No</li>
  <li>Unusual smell or heat: Yes/No</li>
  <li>Final status: Returned to service / Sent to shop</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Effective troubleshooting starts with simple power verification and progresses logically. Most “dead bed” issues are external power-related rather than internal electronic failures. Protect patient safety first, verify basics second, and escalate appropriately when necessary. Clear documentation protects both the department and the patient.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
