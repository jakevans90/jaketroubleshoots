  <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
  <p>This guide addresses situations where the Hillrom Progressa bed scale shows inaccurate weight readings or fails to zero properly. The focus is on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes—such as bed placement, floor surface, load distribution, and scale calibration errors—before assuming internal sensor or electronics failure.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h4>Verify Bed Placement</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the bed is fully on a flat, hard surface. Uneven flooring or partially on a rug can affect the scale reading.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why it matters: Scale sensors rely on even support; tilting can produce inaccurate readings.</p>

  <h4>Check for Obstructions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove any items under or near the bed wheels or frame that may interfere with the scale sensors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why it matters: Objects or debris can prevent proper zeroing.</p>

  <h4>Confirm Bed is Empty</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>No mattress accessories, trays, or patient equipment should be on the bed during zeroing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why it matters: Additional weight will prevent the scale from achieving zero.</p>

  <h4>Engage Zeroing Function</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Press the bed’s scale “Zero” or “Tare” button according to the bed’s user interface.</li>
    <li>Observe if the scale completes the zeroing process.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why it matters: Proper initiation of the zero process ensures baseline calibration.</p>

  <h4>Check Wheel Locks</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure all bed wheels are fully locked. Bed movement during weighing can cause unstable readings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why it matters: Movement interferes with sensor accuracy.</p>

  <h4>Inspect Display and Connections</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the display panel is properly seated and free of error messages.</li>
    <li>Check cables connecting the scale sensors to the control module for loose connections.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why it matters: Intermittent connections can cause erratic readings.</p>

  <h4>Try a Known Weight</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Place a known weight (e.g., a calibration weight or similar) on the bed to verify scale function.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why it matters: Confirms whether the issue is calibration or sensor malfunction.</p>

  <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
  <p>Common external causes (flooring, wheel lock, bed empty, connections) have been ruled out.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Removed from service</li>
    <li>Labeled Out of Service</li>
    <li>Sent for vendor repair or in-house bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember: knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting.</p>

  <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
  <p>Do not weigh patients until the scale is confirmed accurate.</p>
  <p>Move the patient to another bed if possible.</p>
  <p>Troubleshoot only when the bed is unoccupied to prevent patient risk.</p>

  <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
  <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  “Bed scale shows inaccurate readings or fails to zero.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  “Bed on uneven surface; zeroing fails; wheel locks engaged; connections verified but no improvement.”</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
  “Bed removed from service, labeled Out of Service, sent for repair.”</p>

  <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Floor type and condition under the bed</li>
    <li>Wheel lock status</li>
    <li>Display error messages</li>
    <li>Steps attempted to zero</li>
    <li>Known weight testing results</li>
    <li>Final bed status</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>Patient safety and accuracy are paramount. By starting with logical, external checks and escalating appropriately, you ensure safe use of the bed and proper documentation. Thorough troubleshooting prevents unnecessary equipment downtime and avoids risk to patients.</p>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
