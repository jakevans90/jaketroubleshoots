  <p>Error Codes / Self-Test Failure at Power-Up</p>
</section>

<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Electrosurgical Unit (ESU)</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Valleylab</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Force FX</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Valleylab Force FX ESU fails its self-test during power-up, displays an error code, or will not proceed to ready mode.</p>
<p>The focus is on logical, external checks first—such as power supply, accessories, REM connections, and environmental factors—before assuming an internal failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>1. Ensure the Unit Is Not Connected to a Patient</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If connected to an active case, immediately transfer the patient to a backup ESU before troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>Do not power-cycle repeatedly during an active surgical procedure.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Perform a Full Power Reset</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Turn the unit OFF.</li>
  <li>Disconnect the power cord from the wall outlet.</li>
  <li>Wait at least 60 seconds.</li>
  <li>Reconnect directly to a known-good wall outlet (not a power strip).</li>
  <li>Power ON and observe the startup sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Temporary logic faults or voltage instability can trigger self-test failures.</p>

<h4>3. Verify the Wall Outlet and Line Power</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the outlet is hospital-grade and functioning.</li>
  <li>Test outlet with an outlet tester or plug in another known-good device.</li>
  <li>Avoid extension cords or daisy-chained power strips.</li>
</ul>
<p>Power irregularities commonly trigger startup errors.</p>

<h4>4. Disconnect All Accessories</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove active electrode handpiece.</li>
  <li>Disconnect return electrode (REM) cable.</li>
  <li>Remove footswitch.</li>
  <li>Remove any adapters or extension cables.</li>
  <li>Power the unit ON with nothing connected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Faulty accessories can cause impedance or detection errors during self-test.</p>

<h4>5. Inspect the Return Electrode (REM) Port</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check for bent pins.</li>
  <li>Check for debris or fluid contamination.</li>
  <li>Ensure no foreign objects are inside the port.</li>
</ul>
<p>REM detection failures are a common cause of startup errors.</p>

<h4>6. Check for Environmental or Fluid Exposure Issues</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Inspect for signs of fluid ingress.</li>
  <li>Look for corrosion around connectors.</li>
  <li>Note any unusual odor (burning smell).</li>
  <li>Check for excessive heat from the chassis.</li>
</ul>
<p>If fluid intrusion is suspected, stop troubleshooting and escalate.</p>

<h4>7. Document the Exact Error Code Displayed</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Record the exact code and message.</li>
  <li>Note whether the unit fails immediately or midway through self-test.</li>
  <li>Note any audible tones or alarm patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Precise documentation helps determine whether the issue is power supply–related, memory-related, or internal board-related.</p>

<h4>8. Attempt Startup on a Different Circuit (If Available)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Move the unit to a separate, known-good circuit in another room if feasible.</li>
  <li>If the error clears, building power instability may be contributing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If the unit continues to fail self-test after:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Verified power source</li>
  <li>Accessory removal</li>
  <li>Full reset</li>
  <li>Port inspection</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue is likely internal (power supply module, control board, memory fault, or internal calibration failure).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the device from service</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service</li>
  <li>Send for qualified bench evaluation or depot repair</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeated power cycling is not appropriate once external causes are ruled out.</p>
<p>Knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never troubleshoot an ESU that is connected to a patient or sterile field.</p>
<p>Always move the patient to a backup unit first.</p>
<p>ESU failures during surgery present significant patient safety risk.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Unit displays error code during startup and will not enter ready mode.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Unit failed internal self-test at power-up. Error persisted after full power reset and accessory removal. No external power issues identified.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Removed unit from service, labeled Out of Service, and sent to Biomed shop for further evaluation and repair.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Exact error code displayed</li>
  <li>Outlet tested (yes/no)</li>
  <li>Accessories disconnected (yes/no)</li>
  <li>Any unusual odor, sound, or heat</li>
  <li>Final operational status</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Power-up self-test failures on ESUs are often caused by power instability or accessory-related detection faults. Logical external checks protect patient safety and prevent unnecessary internal disassembly. Once external causes are ruled out, timely escalation prevents further damage and ensures reliable surgical performance.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
