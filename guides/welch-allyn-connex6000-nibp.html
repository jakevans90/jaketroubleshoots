  <h2>Welch Allyn Connex 6000 Series</h2>
  <p>NIBP Failure – Leaky Hose / Transducer Drift</p>
</section>

<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">
  <h3>Asset Type</h3>
  <p>Vital Signs Monitor</p>

  <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
  <p>Welch Allyn</p>

  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>Connex 6000 Series</p>

  <h4>Inspect the NIBP Hose</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the hose connecting the cuff to the monitor is fully seated at both ends.</li>
    <li>Examine the hose for cracks, holes, kinks, or wear.</li>
    <li>Replace the hose if any visible damage or leaks are detected. Even a small leak can prevent proper inflation and trigger an NIBP error.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Check the Cuff and Connections</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the cuff is the correct size for the patient.</li>
    <li>Verify the cuff tubing is fully inserted and the hook/Velcro is secure.</li>
    <li>Inspect the bladder for tears or leaks. A poorly seated or damaged cuff can cause failed or inaccurate readings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Verify the Module / Transducer Seating</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the NIBP module is fully inserted in the monitor.</li>
    <li>Check connector pins for cleanliness, corrosion, or damage.</li>
    <li>Look for visible moisture or debris around the module. Loose or misaligned transducers can cause drift or persistent errors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Observe the Display</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Note any error codes (e.g., “NIBP Fail,” “Low Pressure,” “Leak Detected”).</li>
    <li>Record whether the error occurs immediately or intermittently. Documenting these details helps Clinical Engineering track recurring issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Try a Simple Reset</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the cuff and hose from the patient.</li>
    <li>Power cycle the monitor.</li>
    <li>Reconnect the hose and cuff, then attempt another measurement. If successful, the issue may have been a temporary connection or seating problem.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If NIBP measurements still fail after completing the above steps, you have already checked the most common and easily verified causes:
      <ul>
        <li>Hose integrity</li>
        <li>Cuff correctness and placement</li>
        <li>Module/transducer connections</li>
        <li>Simple reset</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The issue is now likely internal (transducer drift, module malfunction, or sensor calibration issue) and cannot be resolved at the bedside.</li>
    <li>Next Steps:
      <ul>
        <li>Remove the monitor from clinical service.</li>
        <li>Clearly label it as Out of Service.</li>
        <li>Send it for repair or bench evaluation. Knowing when to escalate is proper troubleshooting.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not attempt troubleshooting while the patient is attached.</li>
    <li>Move the patient to another monitor or device first.</li>
    <li>Only perform troubleshooting when it is safe to do so, ensuring patient care is uninterrupted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“NIBP measurement failed; error displayed.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Hose inspected and intact, cuff verified, module seated correctly. Measurement still fails. Suspected transducer drift or internal module fault.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Removed monitor from service, labeled Out of Service, sent for repair.”<br>
“Tagged for bench evaluation by CE.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hose checked/replaced</li>
    <li>Cuff verified/replaced</li>
    <li>Module reseated</li>
    <li>Error cleared/persisted</li>
    <li>Any visible damage, moisture, or debris</li>
    <li>Final device disposition (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
