<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Defibrillator</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>ZOLL</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>R Series</p>

<h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a ZOLL R Series defibrillator reports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Pads Not Detected”</li>
  <li>“Therapy Cable Failure”</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps focus on the most common and easily verified external causes before assuming internal device failure. The goal is to quickly restore readiness while protecting patient safety and avoiding unnecessary parts replacement.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>Verify Pads Are Properly Connected</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the therapy pads are fully seated into the therapy cable connector.</li>
  <li>Confirm the therapy cable is securely locked into the defibrillator front port.</li>
  <li>Disconnect and firmly reseat both connections.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this matters: Even a slightly loose or partially seated connector can prevent pad recognition.</em></p>

<h4>Inspect Pads for Physical Damage</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Examine the pads for:</li>
  <li>Torn or cracked electrode surfaces</li>
  <li>Damaged snap connectors</li>
  <li>Dried or lifted gel surface</li>
  <li>Contamination on contact surfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Pads are consumables and subject to handling damage. Replace immediately if any defect is noted.</p>

<h4>Inspect the Therapy Cable</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Visually and physically inspect the entire cable:</li>
  <li>Fraying or exposed wiring</li>
  <li>Kinks or sharp bends near strain relief</li>
  <li>Cracked housing at the connector</li>
  <li>Loose or bent pins</li>
  <li>Gently flex the cable near both ends while observing the screen for intermittent recognition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Intermittent recognition strongly suggests cable conductor fatigue.</p>

<h4>Verify Pad Expiration Date</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm pads are within manufacturer expiration date.</li>
  <li>Expired pads may have degraded conductive gel, leading to detection errors.</li>
  <li>If expired, replace with in-date pads and retest.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Test With a Known-Good Cable or Pad Set</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If available:</li>
  <li>Replace pads with a known-good set.</li>
  <li>If the issue persists, replace the therapy cable with a known-good cable.</li>
  <li>This step isolates whether the problem follows the pads, the cable, or remains with the defibrillator.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Observe the Exact Display Message</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Document:</li>
  <li>Exact wording of the error</li>
  <li>Whether the message appears immediately on power-up</li>
  <li>Whether it is intermittent</li>
  <li>Any audible tones or status indicators</li>
</ul>
<p>Precise messaging helps determine if the issue is cable-related versus internal therapy board failure.</p>

<h4>If the Problem Persists</h4>
<p>If the device continues to report “Pads Not Detected” or “Therapy Cable Failure” after:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reseating connections</li>
  <li>Inspecting for damage</li>
  <li>Replacing pads</li>
  <li>Testing with a known-good cable</li>
</ul>
<p>Then common external causes have been ruled out.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the device from clinical service</li>
  <li>Label the unit Out of Service</li>
  <li>Send for bench evaluation or authorized repair</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not continue repeated cycling or troubleshooting beyond external checks. Knowing when to stop is proper Clinical Engineering practice.</p>

<h4>Clinical Use Tip</h4>
<p>Never troubleshoot pad detection issues on an active patient.</p>

<p>If the unit is in clinical use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Immediately transfer the patient to a backup defibrillator.</li>
  <li>Ensure therapy capability is restored before beginning equipment evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pad detection errors prevent reliable therapy delivery. Device readiness is critical in resuscitation environments.</p>

<h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
<p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>Example:<br>
“R Series defibrillator displays ‘Pads Not Detected’ during daily check.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>Examples:<br>
“Therapy cable intermittently loses connection when flexed near strain relief.”<br>
or<br>
“Pads expired and not recognized by device.”<br>
or<br>
“No issue found with pads or cable; suspected internal therapy board fault.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>Examples:<br>
“Replaced expired pads; unit passed operational check and returned to service.”<br>
“Removed defective therapy cable from service and replaced with known-good cable.”<br>
“Unit removed from service and sent to vendor for evaluation.”</p>

<h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pads reseated: yes / no</li>
  <li>Therapy cable reseated: yes / no</li>
  <li>Visible damage observed: yes / no</li>
  <li>Known-good pads tested: yes / no</li>
  <li>Known-good cable tested: yes / no</li>
  <li>Exact error message</li>
  <li>Pad expiration date</li>
  <li>Intermittent vs constant fault</li>
  <li>Final device status (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thought</h3>
<p>Pad and therapy cable issues are common, external, and often simple to resolve. A structured approach ensures you rule out connection and consumable problems before escalating to internal failure.</p>

<p>Effective troubleshooting means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prioritizing patient safety</li>
  <li>Verifying simple causes first</li>
  <li>Isolating components logically</li>
  <li>Escalating appropriately</li>
  <li>Documenting clearly</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
