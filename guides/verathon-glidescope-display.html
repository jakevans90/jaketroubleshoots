    <h3>Asset Type</h3>

    <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
    <p>Verathon</p>

    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>GlideScope</p>

    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses situations where the GlideScope video display remains blank or fails to power on. It focuses on external, easily verifiable issues—like battery charge, connections, and screen accessories—before assuming internal electronics or board failure. The goal is to restore safe, operational status without disassembling the device.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Check Battery Charge</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the battery is fully charged or connected to a reliable power source.</li>
      <li>A depleted or improperly seated battery is a common cause for a blank screen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Verify Battery Seating and Contacts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove and reinsert the battery.</li>
      <li>Inspect contacts for dirt, corrosion, or misalignment. Clean gently if necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Confirm Power Switch Operation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Press and hold the power button per manufacturer guidance.</li>
      <li>Look for any indicator lights on the handle or display. No lights may indicate power or battery issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inspect Cable Connections</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the blade, handle, and display connections are secure.</li>
      <li>Wiggle connectors gently to verify firm contact. Loose cables can prevent video output.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check Display Brightness and Screen Settings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If the unit powers on but shows a black screen, adjust brightness or input source settings.</li>
      <li>Some models have a standby mode—toggle standby/power to test.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Swap Components if Available</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If another GlideScope handle or battery is available, swap to isolate the issue.</li>
      <li>If the display works with a different handle or battery, the original component may be defective.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inspect for Physical Damage</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Look for cracks, impact damage, or liquid exposure on handle or screen.</li>
      <li>Damage may prevent operation and requires service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>Common external causes have been ruled out.</p>
    <p>Device should be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removed from service</li>
      <li>Labeled Out of Service</li>
      <li>Sent for repair or bench evaluation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stopping here avoids risk of further damage and ensures patient safety.</p>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <p>Never attempt to intubate with a device suspected of failure.</p>
    <p>Move the patient to another verified working GlideScope or alternative airway device.</p>
    <p>Troubleshoot only when the patient is safe and stable.</p>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “GlideScope screen remains blank, unit will not power on.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    Battery was tested and seated correctly, power button responded, cables were connected, but display remained blank.</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    Device removed from service, labeled Out of Service, and sent to Biomedical Engineering for bench evaluation.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Battery voltage/status</li>
      <li>Any indicator lights observed</li>
      <li>Cable or connector integrity</li>
      <li>Evidence of physical damage</li>
      <li>Final device status</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Patient safety is paramount. Logical, stepwise troubleshooting avoids unnecessary disassembly or risk. Knowing when to escalate for repair ensures equipment is safe and reliable. Thorough documentation supports both patient safety and asset tracking.</p>
    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
