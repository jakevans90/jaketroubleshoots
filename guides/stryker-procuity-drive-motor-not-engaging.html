<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Hospital Bed</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Stryker</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>ProCuity</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Stryker ProCuity hospital bed will not move when the drive controls are activated. The bed may power on normally, but pressing the drive enable or directional controls does not result in movement.</p>
<p>This guide focuses on logical, external troubleshooting steps first — power status, brake position, drive enable conditions, and obvious mechanical obstructions — before assuming internal motor or control board failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Verify Bed Power Status</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the bed is powered on and not in a low-battery condition.</li>
  <li>Check the main display for battery indicators or warnings.</li>
  <li>Ensure the bed is plugged into a known good wall outlet if battery level is low.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> The drive motor will not engage if battery voltage is below the safe operating threshold.</p>

<h4>Confirm Brake Status</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify central brake pedal position.</li>
  <li>Ensure the bed is in “neutral” or “steer” mode as appropriate for drive activation.</li>
  <li>Attempt to manually push the bed to confirm brake release.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> Engaged brakes mechanically prevent movement even if the drive motor attempts to activate.</p>

<h4>Verify Drive Enable Control</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the drive handle is fully extended and properly seated.</li>
  <li>Confirm staff are pressing and holding the drive enable switch while attempting movement.</li>
  <li>Inspect the drive handle cable (if applicable) for visible damage or pinching.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> The system requires an intentional enable signal before motor engagement.</p>

<h4>Inspect for Obstructions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check around all four casters and under the bed frame.</li>
  <li>Look for debris, IV tubing, cords, or floor obstructions.</li>
  <li>Confirm casters rotate freely.</li>
  <li>Inspect for string, tape, or debris wrapped around wheels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> Mechanical resistance can prevent drive engagement or cause the system to inhibit motor activation.</p>

<h4>Check Bed Height and Position</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Lower the bed to a standard transport height.</li>
  <li>Ensure side rails are properly latched.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> Certain safety interlocks may prevent drive activation.</p>

<h4>Listen for Motor Activation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Attempt to engage drive while listening closely.</li>
  <li>Do you hear a click, relay activation, or motor hum?</li>
  <li>No sound at all may indicate control or power issue.</li>
  <li>Clicking without movement may indicate mechanical coupling or motor failure.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Perform a Power Reset</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Power the bed off completely.</li>
  <li>Disconnect from AC power for 60 seconds.</li>
  <li>Reconnect and power back on.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> Resets may clear control lockouts or temporary faults.</p>

<h4>Inspect Battery Condition</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check for battery fault indicators.</li>
  <li>If available, swap with a known-good battery (per facility policy).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> Drive motors require higher current draw than basic bed functions. A weak battery may power electronics but not drive motors.</p>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If external causes (brakes, power, controls, obstructions, battery) have been ruled out, the issue is likely internal. Possible causes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Failed drive motor</li>
  <li>Motor controller failure</li>
  <li>Damaged internal harness</li>
  <li>Faulty drive enable switch</li>
  <li>Internal battery pack degradation</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the bed from service</li>
  <li>Label the bed “Out of Service”</li>
  <li>Send for repair or controlled bench evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary disassembly and protects patient safety.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never troubleshoot drive motor issues while a patient is in the bed.</p>
<p>Move the patient to another safe bed first. The drive system is a transport feature and should only be tested when the bed is unoccupied to prevent unintended movement or injury.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Bed powers on but will not move when drive handle is engaged.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
Brakes were engaged. Central brake pedal found in lock position preventing drive activation.</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
Released brakes, verified drive motor engagement, and confirmed proper movement in forward and reverse. Bed returned to service.</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include in Work Order</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested</li>
  <li>Battery charge level</li>
  <li>Brake position verified</li>
  <li>Obstructions cleared</li>
  <li>Motor sound present or absent</li>
  <li>Final functional test results</li>
  <li>Final device status</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Effective troubleshooting starts with simple, logical external checks before assuming complex failure. Protect patient safety by ensuring the bed is unoccupied during testing, and document clearly using CCR methodology. Escalating appropriately is not failure — it is professional judgment.</p>
<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
