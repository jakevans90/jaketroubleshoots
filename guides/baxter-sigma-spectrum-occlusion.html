<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a Baxter SIGMA Spectrum infusion pump will not start an infusion due to an occlusion alarm.</p>
<p>The focus is on logical, external, and easily verifiable causes before assuming internal pump failure. These steps prioritize patient safety, proper escalation, and clear documentation.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the pump is attached to an active patient, coordinate with clinical staff to transition the patient to another infusion pump before troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>Do not troubleshoot extensively while the device is actively infusing a critical medication.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect the IV Set and Tubing Path</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify the tubing is correctly loaded into the pump channel.</li>
  <li>Confirm there are no kinks, sharp bends, compression points, or twisted tubing from the pump to the patient.</li>
  <li>Check that all roller clamps and slide clamps are fully open.</li>
  <li><em>Even minor tubing restriction can generate an occlusion alarm.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4>Check the Patient-Side of the Line</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Inspect the distal tubing and catheter site (visually only — do not manipulate invasive access unless authorized).</li>
  <li>Look for obvious downstream obstruction such as:
    <ul>
      <li>IV pole hooks compressing tubing</li>
      <li>Arm positioning causing line occlusion</li>
      <li>Secondary tubing backflow issues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Occlusion alarms often originate downstream of the pump.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect the Cassette and Pump Door</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Open the pump door and visually inspect the cassette seating.</li>
  <li>Ensure the disposable set is fully aligned and seated properly in the channel.</li>
  <li>Close the door firmly and verify it latches completely.</li>
  <li><em>An improperly seated cassette can cause false occlusion detection.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirm Fluid Source and Prime Status</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify the fluid bag contains adequate volume.</li>
  <li>Ensure the line has been properly primed and contains no large air gaps.</li>
  <li>Check that the spike is fully inserted and that the vent (if applicable) is correctly positioned.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Review Alarm Details on Display</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Note the exact alarm wording (e.g., “Upstream Occlusion” vs. “Downstream Occlusion” if displayed).</li>
  <li>Observe whether the alarm triggers immediately upon start or after pressure builds.</li>
  <li><em>Documenting the exact alarm behavior is important for CCR documentation.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4>Perform a Controlled Reset</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Stop the infusion.</li>
  <li>Remove and reload the tubing.</li>
  <li>Close the door securely.</li>
  <li>Restart the infusion and observe pressure behavior.</li>
  <li><em>If the alarm clears and infusion resumes normally, monitor briefly to ensure stable operation.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If the occlusion alarm continues after completing all external checks, common causes have been ruled out. At this point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the pump from clinical service</li>
  <li>Clearly label it “Out of Service”</li>
  <li>Send for bench evaluation or repair</li>
  <li><em>Persistent occlusion alarms after tubing and cassette verification may indicate internal pressure sensor or mechanism issues.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Knowing when to stop bedside troubleshooting is proper Clinical Engineering practice.</em></p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never attempt extended troubleshooting on an active patient receiving critical medications.</p>
<p>Always transition the patient to a functioning infusion device first. Patient care continuity takes priority over equipment evaluation.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Pump will not start infusion. Occlusion alarm displayed.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Tubing inspected and free of kinks. Clamps open. Cassette reseated. Fluid present and line primed. Alarm persists after reload. Suspect internal pressure sensing issue.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Removed pump from service, labeled Out of Service, sent to CE shop for evaluation.”<br>
or<br>
“Bench tested; unable to clear occlusion alarm. Forwarded for repair.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tubing inspected and/or replaced</li>
  <li>Clamps verified open</li>
  <li>Cassette reseated</li>
  <li>Fluid bag checked and primed</li>
  <li>Alarm type noted (upstream/downstream)</li>
  <li>Alarm cleared or persisted</li>
  <li>Any abnormal sounds or resistance felt</li>
  <li>Final device disposition</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>An occlusion alarm is often caused by simple external flow restriction. Systematically checking tubing, clamps, cassette seating, and fluid source prevents unnecessary repairs and protects patient safety.</p>
<p>Clear documentation, logical troubleshooting, and proper escalation reflect strong Clinical Engineering practice.</p>
<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
