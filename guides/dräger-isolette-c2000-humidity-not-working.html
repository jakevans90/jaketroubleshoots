<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Infant Incubator</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Dräger</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Isolette C2000</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Isolette C2000 humidity system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does not produce humidity</li>
  <li>Displays low humidity despite being enabled</li>
  <li>Leaks water from the reservoir area</li>
  <li>Triggers humidity-related alarms</li>
</ul>

<p>The focus is on logical, external, and easily verifiable causes first—such as reservoir placement, water level, seals, and setup—before assuming heater or internal humidity control failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure the Infant Is Safely Relocated</h4>
<p>Before beginning troubleshooting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transfer the patient to another properly functioning incubator.</li>
  <li>Do not troubleshoot humidity issues with an active patient inside.</li>
  <li>Humidity instability can impact thermoregulation and infection risk in neonates.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirm Humidity Mode Is Enabled</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify humidity is turned ON in the control settings.</li>
  <li>Verify a target humidity level is set.</li>
  <li>Verify the system is not in a mode that disables humidification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Humidity heaters will not energize if humidity is disabled in software.</p>

<h4>Check Water Reservoir Level</h4>
<p>Remove and inspect the water reservoir:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm it contains sterile or distilled water (per facility policy).</li>
  <li>Ensure it is not empty.</li>
  <li>Ensure it is not overfilled past the maximum fill line.</li>
</ul>

<p>Helpful Details to Observe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cracks in the reservoir</li>
  <li>Discoloration</li>
  <li>Warping</li>
  <li>Mineral buildup</li>
</ul>

<p>If empty, refill and properly reseat.</p>

<h4>Verify Reservoir Seating and Alignment</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm it clicks fully into place.</li>
  <li>Confirm it sits flush with the housing.</li>
  <li>Confirm no gaps are visible.</li>
  <li>Confirm the latch (if applicable) is secure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why this matters: Improper seating can prevent water from feeding to the heater, trigger false low humidity alarms, and cause external leaking.</p>

<h4>Inspect for External Leaks</h4>
<p>Check around:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reservoir gasket/seal</li>
  <li>Bottom of the humidity compartment</li>
  <li>Under the unit base</li>
  <li>Around drain ports (if applicable)</li>
</ul>

<p>Look for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Water pooling</li>
  <li>Damp surfaces</li>
  <li>Mineral residue trails</li>
</ul>

<p>If leaking is present:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the reservoir.</li>
  <li>Inspect gasket for cracks, flattening, or debris.</li>
  <li>Clean mating surfaces.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check for Obstruction or Mineral Buildup</h4>
<p>If humidity is not rising:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inspect the humidity chamber area (without deep disassembly).</li>
  <li>Look for visible scale buildup.</li>
  <li>Confirm the water pathway is not blocked.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why this matters: Mineral buildup can prevent proper vapor generation or water flow.</p>

<p>If heavy buildup is suspected, remove from service for cleaning per facility procedure.</p>

<h4>Monitor Heater Activation Indicators</h4>
<ul>
  <li>With humidity enabled and reservoir properly installed, listen for normal heater cycling sounds.</li>
  <li>Monitor humidity percentage increase over 10–15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Check for error codes.</li>
</ul>

<p>If humidity does not increase at all, the heater does not appear to energize, or alarms persist, the issue may involve the humidity heater element, temperature sensor, or control board.</p>

<h4>Check Environmental Factors</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm room temperature is within normal operating range.</li>
  <li>Confirm access doors and portholes are fully closed.</li>
  <li>Confirm gaskets around doors are intact.</li>
</ul>

<p>Open panels or poor sealing can cause humidity loss that mimics system failure.</p>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If reservoir is properly filled and seated, no external leaks are found, humidity mode is enabled, and environmental seals are intact, yet humidity still does not rise or leaking continues, the issue is likely internal (heater assembly, sensor, control board, internal tubing, or internal seal failure).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the device from service.</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service.</li>
  <li>Send for bench evaluation or qualified repair.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting. Internal humidity systems are not field-repair components during active service.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Humidity directly impacts neonatal thermoregulation and skin integrity.</p>
<p>Never troubleshoot humidity performance with an infant inside the incubator. Always transfer the patient to a safe alternative device before evaluation.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“NICU staff reported humidity not increasing above 30% and water leaking from base of incubator.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Water reservoir improperly seated; gasket folded under lip causing leak and poor water feed to heater.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Reseated reservoir properly, corrected gasket alignment, verified humidity increased to setpoint (60%) within 15 minutes. No further leakage observed. Returned unit to service.”<br><br>
“Removed unit from service and sent for bench evaluation of humidity heater assembly.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Water level confirmed</li>
  <li>Reservoir condition</li>
  <li>Gasket condition</li>
  <li>Humidity setpoint</li>
  <li>Actual humidity reading</li>
  <li>Leak location (if present)</li>
  <li>Alarm behavior</li>
  <li>Final operational status</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Effective troubleshooting starts with simple, external causes. Most humidity issues involve reservoir placement, water level, or sealing problems. When those are ruled out, escalating appropriately protects both the patient and the equipment. Clear documentation ensures continuity of care and proper maintenance tracking.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
