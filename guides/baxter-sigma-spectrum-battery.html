<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Baxter</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>SIGMA Spectrum</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where a SIGMA Spectrum infusion pump will not power on using battery power, shuts down unexpectedly when unplugged, or does not appear to charge.</p>

<p>The focus is on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes first—such as AC power issues, battery seating, power cord integrity, and charging indicators—before assuming internal power supply or battery pack failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>1. Confirm Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the pump is connected to a patient and loses power, immediately transfer the infusion to another functioning pump.</li>
  <li>Do not troubleshoot while actively infusing unless patient safety is assured.</li>
  <li>Power issues can directly interrupt therapy. Always secure the patient first.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Verify AC Power Source</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the outlet is live (test with outlet tester or plug in known-working device).</li>
  <li>Ensure the hospital-grade power cord is fully seated in both the wall outlet and pump.</li>
  <li>Inspect the cord for:
    <ul>
      <li>Cuts or fraying</li>
      <li>Loose IEC connection</li>
      <li>Bent blades</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A loose AC connection is one of the most common causes of “dead” pumps.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Check for Charging Indicators</h4>
<ul>
  <li>With AC connected:</li>
  <li>Confirm the pump powers on.</li>
  <li>Observe battery charging icon on display.</li>
  <li>Check for any battery-related alerts or warnings.</li>
  <li>If the pump powers on with AC but immediately shuts off when unplugged, the internal battery is likely not holding a charge.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Perform a Controlled Power Test</h4>
<ul>
  <li>With the pump powered on and AC connected:</li>
  <li>Allow the pump to charge for at least 30–60 minutes.</li>
  <li>Disconnect AC power.</li>
  <li>Observe whether:
    <ul>
      <li>The pump remains powered</li>
      <li>It immediately shuts down</li>
      <li>It displays a low battery warning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If it shuts down immediately after charging, suspect battery degradation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Inspect Battery Installation (If Accessible Without Disassembly)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If your facility policy allows battery access:</li>
  <li>Remove the pump from service.</li>
  <li>Inspect battery compartment for:
    <ul>
      <li>Proper seating</li>
      <li>Corrosion</li>
      <li>Loose connectors</li>
      <li>Swelling</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do not open internal electronics beyond standard battery access.</li>
  <li>If swelling or leakage is observed, remove from service immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Check for Excessive Heat or Odor</h4>
<ul>
  <li>During charging:</li>
  <li>Feel for abnormal heat near battery compartment.</li>
  <li>Note any unusual smell.</li>
  <li>Excess heat may indicate internal charging circuit issues.</li>
</ul>

<h4>7. Review Service History</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check maintenance records for:</li>
  <li>Age of battery</li>
  <li>Previous battery replacements</li>
  <li>Repeated battery-related complaints</li>
  <li>SIGMA Spectrum batteries have a finite lifespan and commonly require periodic replacement based on usage cycles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The outlet and cord are verified functional</li>
  <li>The pump operates on AC but not battery</li>
  <li>Charging indicators are abnormal</li>
  <li>The battery fails a controlled charge test</li>
</ul>

<p>Then common external causes have been ruled out.</p>

<p>The issue is likely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Degraded internal battery pack</li>
  <li>Failed charging circuit</li>
  <li>Internal power supply board issue</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the device from service</li>
  <li>Label as Out of Service</li>
  <li>Send for battery replacement or bench evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary risk and protects patient safety.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never attempt to “see if it lasts” on a low battery during active infusion.</p>

<p>If battery reliability is questionable, transfer the patient to a verified pump before testing. Power instability directly impacts therapy continuity.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Nursing reports pump shuts off when unplugged and will not stay on battery.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Pump powered normally on AC. After 45-minute charge, unit shut down immediately when AC removed. Battery failed functional hold test.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Removed from service. Replaced internal battery per facility protocol. Performed operational verification and battery runtime test. Returned to service.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested and verified functional</li>
  <li>Power cord swapped and tested</li>
  <li>Battery indicator behavior noted</li>
  <li>Duration of charge before testing</li>
  <li>Any heat or odor observed</li>
  <li>Final device status (Returned to Service or Sent for Repair)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Power issues should always be approached logically—starting with the simplest external checks before assuming internal failure. Proper escalation protects patients and prevents unnecessary downtime. Clear documentation ensures trend tracking and supports lifecycle planning for battery replacement.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
