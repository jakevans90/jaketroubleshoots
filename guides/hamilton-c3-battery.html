  <main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">
    <h3>Asset Type</h3>
    <p>Ventilator</p>

    <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
    <p>Hamilton Medical</p>

    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>C3</p>

    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses a situation where the battery in a Hamilton‑C3 ventilator won’t hold a charge or quickly discharges after being fully charged. The goal is to help identify common external causes first (power connection, battery condition, charging behavior) before assuming an internal failure. The C3’s battery is a rechargeable lithium‑ion pack that provides backup power and must be routinely maintained and replaced when worn out.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Confirm Connection to Primary Power (AC/DC)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the ventilator is connected to AC mains or appropriate DC power and verify the charging indicator shows a charge in progress.</li>
      <li>The batteries charge only when primary power is present; if there’s no proper connection to mains or DC, the battery won’t charge fully.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check Battery Charge Indicator Icons</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Look at the display icons for battery status (green = charged; orange/green = partial; crossed‑out = discharged/defective).</li>
      <li>A crossed‑out battery symbol often means the battery is discharged or faulty.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Verify Battery Age and Usage History</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Batteries have a limited cycle life (typically a few hundred cycles for medical ventilator Li‑ion cells). If the battery is old or has been deeply discharged repeatedly, capacity will degrade.</li>
      <li>Hospitals often find every 2–3 years battery life drops significantly; a failing pack won’t hold charge even after charging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ensure Proper Charging Period</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Charge on primary power for several hours (4+ hours) to bring battery up to 80‑100% per the manual before testing how long it holds. Short charge cycles may not allow full capacity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Swap or Test With Second Battery (if installed)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If the C3 has two batteries installed, swap them to see if one holds charge better. A rapid drop in available time on battery suggests the pack itself is worn.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check Operating Environment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>High temperatures during charging or storage and prolonged idle periods without use can degrade battery performance. Store spare batteries in cool, dry conditions and cycle them monthly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>If the above steps (power checks, charging behavior, battery status indicators) confirm:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ventilator is connected to primary power properly,</li>
      <li>The battery still discharges rapidly even after full charging,</li>
      <li>The battery icon still shows degraded/discharged status,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>then the battery pack is likely at end‑of‑life or defective.</p>

    <p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace the battery with a genuine Hamilton Medical battery (e.g., PN 369106/NL2024HD pack).</li>
      <li>Label the device Out of Service if no charged battery is available.</li>
      <li>Arrange bench evaluation/repair if battery replacement does not improve performance. Plugging a bad battery into the ventilator can mask deeper electrical issues; avoid further use until resolved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Never troubleshoot a ventilator’s power issue on an actively ventilated patient.</li>
      <li>If battery alarms or power issues occur, connect to AC power immediately.</li>
      <li>If battery backup fails, transition the patient to alternative ventilation first, then proceed with battery troubleshooting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Battery will not retain charge; battery time drops to near zero shortly after full charge.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Battery status indicator shows degraded battery despite being connected to primary power for &gt;4 hours; battery is likely worn out.”</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    “Replaced ventilator battery with a new Hamilton Medical Li‑ion battery pack; verified charging and normal battery run‑time.”</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Alarm behavior</li>
      <li>Power connection verified</li>
      <li>Battery icon status</li>
      <li>Battery age and cycle history</li>
      <li>Charging period duration</li>
      <li>Operating environment temperature</li>
      <li>Final device status after battery replacement</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Routine maintenance of backup batteries is crucial for ventilators that may be moved or used where mains power is intermittent. Tracking battery age, ensuring full charge cycles, and replacing worn packs proactively enhances patient safety and equipment reliability.</p>

    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
