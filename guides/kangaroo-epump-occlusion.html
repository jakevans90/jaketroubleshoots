<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Feeding Pump</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Cardinal Health</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Kangaroo ePump</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Kangaroo ePump feeding pump triggers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Occlusion alarms (indicating blockage or high resistance in the tubing)</li>
  <li>Air-in-line alarms (indicating air detected in the feeding line)</li>
</ul>
<p>It focuses on external, easily verifiable causes—such as tubing, connections, and setup—before assuming an internal pump fault.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Stop feeding and switch the patient to an alternate safe delivery method if needed.</li>
  <li>Never troubleshoot while feeding is actively occurring.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Tubing and Connections</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify the feeding set is properly seated in the pump cassette.</li>
  <li>Ensure all tubing clamps are open and tubing is not kinked, pinched, or twisted.</li>
  <li>Confirm the correct feeding set and syringe size are in use per the pump instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reason:</em> Occlusion and air alarms often occur due to tubing misalignment or mechanical restriction.</p>

<h4>Inspect the Pump Cassette</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the cassette and check for cracks, debris, or worn rollers.</li>
  <li>Reinsert securely, ensuring it clicks into position.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reason:</em> Misseated or damaged cassettes can trigger false occlusion alarms.</p>

<h4>Check Feeding Formula and Syringe</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify the formula viscosity is within pump specifications. Highly viscous formulas can trigger occlusion alarms.</li>
  <li>Inspect syringe for air bubbles and ensure it is properly primed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reason:</em> Air-in-line alarms are often caused by trapped air in the syringe or tubing.</p>

<h4>Prime the Line</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Manually prime the tubing to remove any air before starting the pump.</li>
  <li>Ensure the line is fully filled with formula, no air pockets remain.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reason:</em> Proper priming prevents air detection errors.</p>

<h4>Check Pump Settings and Pressure</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm that flow rate and volume settings match prescribed parameters.</li>
  <li>Reduce flow rate if alarms persist, as high resistance at high flow can trigger occlusion alarms.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect Electrical / Power Connections</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the pump is plugged in or fully charged. Low battery conditions can occasionally cause erratic alarm behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>All external causes (tubing, cassette, syringe, priming, settings) have been ruled out.</p>
<p>The device should be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removed from service</li>
  <li>Labeled Out of Service</li>
  <li>Sent for repair or bench evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing when to stop is part of proper troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Always verify patient safety before troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>Use backup feeding methods if the pump cannot be safely used.</li>
  <li>Document any recurring issues for trend analysis—repeated false occlusions may indicate early cassette wear or internal pump issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
Pump triggers occlusion alarm when delivering 20 mL/hour feeding.</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
Tubing was kinked near the cassette; small air bubble detected in syringe line.</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
Replaced tubing, primed line to remove air, reseated cassette; pump resumed normal operation.</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tubing type and lot number</li>
  <li>Syringe size and formula viscosity</li>
  <li>Flow rate and settings at alarm time</li>
  <li>Battery status and power source</li>
  <li>Any error codes displayed</li>
  <li>Final pump operation status after troubleshooting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Effective troubleshooting of the Kangaroo ePump relies on systematic, external checks first. Patient safety is paramount. Documenting your findings ensures accountability and supports predictive maintenance. Escalate promptly when internal faults are suspected.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
