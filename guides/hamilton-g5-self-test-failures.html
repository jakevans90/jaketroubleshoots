<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Ventilator</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Hamilton</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>G5</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>

<p>This guide addresses situations where the Hamilton G5 ventilator:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fails to complete startup self-test</li>
<li>Displays error messages during power-on</li>
<li>Freezes or locks during initialization</li>
<li>Does not enter normal ventilation mode after boot</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide focuses on logical, external checks first—power, gas supply, accessories, and setup—before assuming internal hardware failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure the Patient Is Safely Supported</h4>
<ul>
<li>Do not troubleshoot while connected to a patient.</li>
<li>Transfer the patient to another ventilator before proceeding.</li>
<li>Confirm alternative ventilation is stable.</li>
<li>Patient safety is always the first step.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify AC Power Source</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the power cord is fully seated at both the ventilator and wall outlet.</li>
<li>Test the wall outlet with a known working device.</li>
<li>Avoid power strips if possible—plug directly into a hospital-grade outlet.</li>
<li>Confirm the power indicator LED illuminates when plugged in.</li>
<li>Startup failures are frequently related to unstable or intermittent AC power.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Battery Status</h4>
<ul>
<li>Attempt startup on AC power with battery installed.</li>
<li>If unit attempts to boot then shuts down, battery may be severely depleted or failed.</li>
<li>Remove and reseat the battery if accessible without disassembly.</li>
<li>Observe battery indicator messages during startup.</li>
<li>A failing internal battery can interrupt self-test even when AC is connected.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify Gas Supply Connections</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm oxygen and air hoses are properly connected and fully seated.</li>
<li>Ensure wall gas pressure is within normal range (typically ~50 psi in U.S. facilities).</li>
<li>Swap gas hoses with known-good hoses if supply pressure alarms appear.</li>
<li>Listen for leaks at quick-connect fittings.</li>
<li>The G5 performs gas pressure checks during startup. Insufficient supply can stop the self-test.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect Patient Circuit and Flow Sensor</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove the patient circuit and attempt startup without the circuit attached.</li>
<li>Inspect the flow sensor for moisture, contamination, or incorrect orientation.</li>
<li>Ensure expiratory valve assembly is properly seated.</li>
<li>Replace with known-good components if available.</li>
<li>Improperly installed or contaminated components can trigger self-test failure.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Observe and Document Error Messages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Record exact wording of error messages or codes.</li>
<li>Note whether failure occurs immediately or at a specific phase (e.g., leak test, valve test).</li>
<li>Listen for abnormal sounds (clicking, repeated cycling, no compressor sound).</li>
<li>Pattern recognition helps determine whether the issue is accessory-related or internal.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Power Cycle Properly</h4>
<ul>
<li>Turn unit fully off.</li>
<li>Disconnect AC power for 60 seconds.</li>
<li>Reconnect and attempt a clean startup.</li>
<li>This allows internal capacitors and logic boards to fully reset.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect for Environmental Factors</h4>
<ul>
<li>Check for excessive dust buildup around air intake filters.</li>
<li>Ensure rear cooling vents are not obstructed.</li>
<li>Confirm the unit is not overheated.</li>
<li>Thermal or airflow restrictions may interrupt boot sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>

<p>If:</p>

<ul>
<li>Power source is verified</li>
<li>Gas supply is confirmed</li>
<li>Circuit and flow sensor are ruled out</li>
<li>Battery is not the issue</li>
<li>Error persists consistently</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is likely internal (power supply module, internal valve calibration failure, sensor failure, or control board issue).</p>

<p>At this point:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the ventilator from service</li>
<li>Label clearly as Out of Service</li>
<li>Send for bench evaluation or authorized repair</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting. Avoid internal disassembly beyond approved service-level access.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>

<p>Never attempt extended troubleshooting while a patient is unstable or dependent on the ventilator. Always transition the patient first. A delayed repair is acceptable. Compromised ventilation is not.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Ventilator fails startup self-test and displays system failure during boot.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Unit failed during valve calibration phase. Verified AC power, gas supply at 50 psi, replaced circuit and flow sensor with known-good components. Error persisted after power cycle.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Removed from service. Labeled Out of Service. Sent to bench for internal evaluation and repair.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>

<ul>
<li>Outlet tested and verified</li>
<li>Gas pressure verified</li>
<li>Battery status observed</li>
<li>Circuit swapped</li>
<li>Flow sensor replaced</li>
<li>Exact error message recorded</li>
<li>Whether unit fully powers on or shuts down</li>
<li>Final device status (Removed from Service)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>

<p>Effective troubleshooting begins with simple, external checks. Many startup failures are caused by power, gas supply, or accessory issues—not internal boards. When logical steps rule out common causes, escalation is appropriate. Clear documentation protects both the patient and the department.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
