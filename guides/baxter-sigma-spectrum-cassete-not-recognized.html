  <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
  <p>This guide addresses situations where the SIGMA Spectrum infusion pump fails to recognize the cassette or IV set. The focus is on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes first—such as cassette seating, sensor cleanliness, and setup errors—before assuming internal hardware failure.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h4>Verify Pump Power and Status</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the pump is powered on and the display shows the main screen.</li>
    <li>Confirm battery or AC power is adequate; low power can prevent sensor operation.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Some pumps disable sensor detection under low battery or power instability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Check Cassette Orientation and Seating</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the cassette/set and inspect the orientation. Ensure it is inserted correctly per the labeled guide.</li>
    <li>Re-seat the cassette firmly until it clicks into place.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Misalignment is a common cause of recognition failure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Inspect the Cassette/Sensor Interface</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Examine the pump’s sensor area and cassette for dirt, fluid, or debris.</li>
    <li>Wipe gently with a lint-free cloth if necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Obstructions can block optical or mechanical sensors from detecting the cassette.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Inspect the Cassette/Set Itself</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Check for visible damage, cracks, or expired tubing.</li>
    <li>Ensure the cassette is compatible with the SIGMA Spectrum pump model.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Non-compatible or damaged cassettes will not be recognized.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Power Cycle the Pump</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn off the pump completely, wait 10–15 seconds, and power it back on.</li>
    <li>Reinsert the cassette and observe if it is recognized.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Temporary sensor or software errors can clear with a power cycle.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Try a Known Good Cassette/Set</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If available, insert a different, verified functional cassette to see if the pump recognizes it.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Confirms whether the issue is with the pump or the cassette itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
  <p>Common external causes (misalignment, debris, power issues, incompatible set) have been ruled out.</p>
  <p>The pump should be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Removed from service</li>
    <li>Labeled Out of Service</li>
    <li>Sent for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Knowing when to escalate is proper troubleshooting and ensures patient safety.</p>

  <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
  <p>Never troubleshoot a cassette while it is connected to a patient.</p>
  <p>If infusion is critical, switch the patient to a verified working pump before troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>Ensure alarms are silenced only when the patient is safely on another pump.</p>

  <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
  <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  “Pump does not recognize cassette/IV set.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  “Sensor area clean, cassette correctly oriented; verified known-good cassette recognized—original set may be damaged or incompatible.”</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
  “Original cassette removed from service; patient switched to verified pump; pump labeled Out of Service and sent for repair.”</p>

  <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AC outlet verified</li>
    <li>Battery level adequate</li>
    <li>Cassette orientation checked</li>
    <li>Sensor area clean</li>
    <li>Cassette compatibility confirmed</li>
    <li>Alarm messages displayed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>Patient safety and logical troubleshooting are the priority. Always start with simple checks and escalate only when necessary. Proper CCR documentation preserves a clear record for follow-up, maintenance, and regulatory compliance.</p>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
