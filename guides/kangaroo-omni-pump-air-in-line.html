<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Kangaroo OMNI</p>

<h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a Kangaroo Omni feeding pump is generating Air-in-Line alarms.</p>
<p>The focus is on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes—such as improper priming, loose connections, empty feeding bags, or cassette seating—before assuming internal air sensor failure. These steps prioritize patient safety and proper escalation.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>Ensure the Patient Is Safe</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the feeding has been paused appropriately and the patient is clinically stable.</li>
<li>If needed, transition the patient to another feeding pump before continuing troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify the Feeding Bag Is Not Empty</h4>
<ul>
<li>Check the formula bag. A nearly empty or empty bag is the most common cause of air entering the tubing.</li>
<li>If empty, replace the bag and re-prime the set.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect the Tubing for Visible Air</h4>
<ul>
<li>Visually inspect the entire length of tubing from bag to patient.</li>
<li>Look for:</li>
<li>Air gaps</li>
<li>Large bubbles</li>
<li>Foam (common with certain formulas)</li>
<li>Even small air pockets near the cassette can trigger the sensor.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Re-Prime the Feeding Set</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the pump’s prime function to fully purge air from the tubing.</li>
<li>Ensure formula completely fills the tubing with no visible bubbles before reconnecting to the patient.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Cassette Seating</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open the pump access panel and remove the feeding set cassette.</li>
<li>Inspect for:</li>
<li>Improper seating</li>
<li>Kinked tubing within the cassette path</li>
<li>Residual formula preventing proper alignment</li>
<li>Reseat the cassette firmly and close the panel completely.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect All Luer and Tubing Connections</h4>
<ul>
<li>Check for loose connections between:</li>
<li>Feeding bag and tubing</li>
<li>Tubing and extension sets</li>
<li>Extension set and patient tube</li>
<li>Loose fittings can draw air into the line without visible leakage.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Evaluate Formula Type and Foam</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some formulas produce foam during shaking or transport.</li>
<li>If foam is present:</li>
<li>Allow the bag to sit upright for several minutes</li>
<li>Avoid aggressive squeezing or shaking</li>
<li>Re-prime slowly</li>
</ul>

<h4>Swap the Feeding Set (If Needed)</h4>
<ul>
<li>If alarms persist after proper priming and inspection, replace the disposable feeding set.</li>
<li>Micro-leaks or manufacturing defects can introduce air intermittently.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Test the Pump Without a Patient</h4>
<ul>
<li>After corrections, run the pump briefly off the patient into a container to confirm the alarm does not recur before returning to service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If the Problem Persists</h3>
<p>If air-in-line alarms continue after:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirmed full priming</li>
<li>Verified no visible air</li>
<li>Replaced feeding bag</li>
<li>Replaced feeding set</li>
<li>Confirmed proper cassette seating</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue may involve an internal air detection sensor or cassette pressure system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the pump from service</li>
<li>Label it Out of Service</li>
<li>Send for bench evaluation or repair</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop and escalate is proper troubleshooting.</p>

<h3>Clinical Use Tip</h3>
<p>Never troubleshoot an air-in-line alarm on an actively feeding patient.</p>
<p>Pause feeding and ensure patient stability first.</p>
<p>Air alarms are a safety feature designed to prevent air delivery into the GI tract. Always clear air completely before resuming feeding.</p>

<h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>Nursing reports pump alarming “Air in Line” repeatedly and feeding will not continue.</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>Air observed in tubing near cassette. Feeding bag nearly empty. Foam present in formula.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>No visible air. Alarm persisted after re-priming. Suspected internal air sensor issue.</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>Replaced feeding bag and fully re-primed tubing. Alarm cleared. Pump tested and returned to service.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Replaced feeding set and verified proper cassette seating. Alarm resolved.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Removed pump from service for further evaluation after repeated alarms with no visible air source.</p>

<h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Was the bag empty or low?</li>
<li>Was visible air present?</li>
<li>Was tubing re-primed?</li>
<li>Was feeding set replaced?</li>
<li>Cassette reseated?</li>
<li>Formula type noted?</li>
<li>Alarm behavior (continuous vs intermittent)?</li>
<li>Final device status (returned to service or sent for repair)?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thought</h3>
<p>Air-in-line alarms are commonly caused by incomplete priming, loose connections, or empty feeding bags. A calm, visual inspection and systematic correction of simple causes will resolve most cases. When external causes are ruled out, proper escalation protects both the patient and the integrity of the equipment program. Clear documentation ensures traceability and supports future trend analysis.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
