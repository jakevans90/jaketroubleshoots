<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Oxygen Flowmeter</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>AirLife</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>FlowMate</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the AirLife FlowMate flowmeter:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Emits hissing or whistling sounds during use</li>
  <li>Shows visible leaks around connections, tubing, or the meter itself</li>
  <li>Fails to deliver proper flow due to possible leaks</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus is on logical, external, and easily verifiable causes first—before assuming internal failure or replacement is required.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure Device is Off / Safe to Inspect</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the oxygen source is off and the patient has been moved to another device if in use.</li>
  <li>Patient safety is priority; never troubleshoot a flowmeter under active patient use.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect Connections and Fittings</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check inlet and outlet connections for tightness.</li>
  <li>Inspect for any misaligned or cross-threaded fittings.</li>
  <li>Loose connections are a common cause of hissing leaks.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Examine Tubing and Attachments</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Look for cracks, splits, or worn areas in oxygen tubing.</li>
  <li>Replace any tubing showing wear.</li>
  <li>Ensure all tubing is fully seated on barbed connectors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Flowmeter Orientation and Installation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the flowmeter is upright and properly mounted according to manufacturer guidance.</li>
  <li>Flowmeters that are tilted or improperly seated can leak or produce noise.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Test the Needle Valve and Flow Adjustment Knob</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Slowly adjust the flow from zero to the prescribed setting.</li>
  <li>Listen for persistent hissing at full or mid-range flow.</li>
  <li>A hissing that persists regardless of flow setting may indicate an internal leak.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check for External Obstructions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove any humidifiers, adapters, or connectors temporarily.</li>
  <li>Test the flowmeter alone to determine if an accessory is causing the noise or leak.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>External causes have been ruled out.</p>
<p>The leak is likely internal, possibly in the needle valve or internal seals.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the flowmeter from service.</li>
  <li>Label as Out of Service.</li>
  <li>Send for vendor repair or in-house bench evaluation if trained personnel are available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing when to stop is part of proper troubleshooting—do not attempt internal disassembly beyond what is safe and authorized.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Never troubleshoot on an active patient. Move the patient to another oxygen source before testing.</li>
  <li>Always verify oxygen flow to the patient before and after replacing or removing a flowmeter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Flowmeter makes hissing sound and may be leaking oxygen.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
Observed loose tubing, misaligned connections, and persistent hissing despite proper setup.</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
Tightened connections and replaced worn tubing. If leak persisted, flowmeter removed from service and labeled Out of Service for repair.</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested for pressure drop</li>
  <li>Tubing replaced or swapped</li>
  <li>Flow adjustment knob behavior</li>
  <li>Location of leak or hissing sound</li>
  <li>Final device status: functional after tubing/fittings corrected or sent for repair</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Patient safety is paramount. Systematic, external checks often resolve oxygen flowmeter issues. Escalate to repair only when safe troubleshooting has been exhausted. Proper documentation ensures repeatable, safe workflows and aids in cost avoidance.</p>
<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
