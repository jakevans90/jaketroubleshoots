    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>Prime Plus</p>

    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a Verathon Prime Plus bladder scanner reports probe or transducer errors. It focuses on simple, external checks that are most commonly associated with probe errors before assuming internal failure. These steps prioritize patient safety, proper escalation, and documentation.</p>

    <h4>Power Cycle the Device</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn the scanner off, wait 10–15 seconds, and turn it back on.</li>
      <li><em>Rationale:</em> Clears temporary software glitches that may trigger false probe errors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inspect the Probe Cable</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Check for visible cuts, kinks, or frayed wires along the cable.</li>
      <li>Ensure connectors are fully seated in the scanner port.</li>
      <li><em>Rationale:</em> Loose or damaged cables are the most common cause of transducer errors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Clean the Probe and Connector</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Use manufacturer-approved cleaning wipes or solutions.</li>
      <li>Remove any gel residue or debris from the probe tip and connector pins.</li>
      <li><em>Rationale:</em> Dirt or residual gel can interfere with ultrasound signal transmission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Swap the Probe (If Available)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect a known-good probe to the scanner.</li>
      <li><em>Rationale:</em> Confirms whether the error is with the probe or the scanner itself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Verify Software / Firmware Status</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the device screen for firmware version and error logs.</li>
      <li>Apply any manufacturer-recommended updates if safely possible.</li>
      <li><em>Rationale:</em> Some probe errors may be triggered by outdated software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check Environmental Factors</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the scanner is not exposed to extreme temperatures or moisture.</li>
      <li><em>Rationale:</em> Ultrasound transducers can be sensitive to environmental conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All external and easily verifiable causes have been ruled out.</li>
      <li>Label the device Out of Service.</li>
      <li>Remove it from patient care and escalate for vendor repair or bench evaluation.</li>
      <li><em>Knowing when to stop and escalate is a key part of proper troubleshooting.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not use the bladder scanner on an active patient if a probe error is present.</li>
      <li>If imaging is needed, move the patient to another functional scanner.</li>
      <li>Always ensure patient safety before troubleshooting or swapping probes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
Device reports “Probe Error” or “Transducer Error.”<br>
    Example: “User reported intermittent probe error during catheter volume scan.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
Observed issues with probe cable, connectors, or probe contamination.<br>
    Example: “Probe connector pins were dirty, or cable showed minor fraying.”</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
Cleaned probe and connector, reseated cable, power-cycled device.<br>
    Tested with a known-good probe.<br>
    Device returned to service or labeled Out of Service if error persisted.<br>
    Example: “After cleaning and power cycle, error resolved with same probe. Device returned to service.”</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cable integrity check (any kinks or cuts)</li>
      <li>Probe tip condition (gel residue, scratches)</li>
      <li>Connector pins (clean and fully seated)</li>
      <li>Error message wording / code</li>
      <li>Device firmware version</li>
      <li>Final device status (in service, out of service)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Logical, stepwise troubleshooting ensures patient safety while protecting the device from unnecessary internal handling. Proper documentation and knowing when to escalate are essential components of efficient Clinical Engineering practice.</p>

    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
