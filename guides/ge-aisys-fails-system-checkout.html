<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the GE Healthcare Aisys anesthesia machine fails its automated system checkout or self-test during startup.</p>

<p>System checkout failures are commonly related to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Breathing circuit leaks</li>
  <li>Improperly seated vaporizers</li>
  <li>Incomplete circuit setup</li>
  <li>Gas supply issues</li>
  <li>Flow sensor or pressure test failures</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide focuses on logical, external checks before assuming internal component failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure the Machine Is Not Connected to a Patient</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Never troubleshoot system checkout failures while connected to an active patient.</li>
  <li>Move the patient to an alternate anesthesia machine before proceeding.</li>
  <li>This protects patient safety and allows a full test cycle without interruption.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify Proper Circuit Setup</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Aisys performs a leak and compliance test during checkout.</li>
  <li>Check that a full breathing circuit is installed.</li>
  <li>Inspiratory and expiratory limbs are connected securely.</li>
  <li>The Y-piece is capped during the leak test.</li>
  <li>The reservoir bag is installed properly.</li>
  <li>APL valve is appropriately adjusted (per test instructions).</li>
  <li>A missing cap or loose fitting is one of the most common causes of checkout failure.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect for Obvious Leaks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Visually and manually inspect CO₂ absorber canister seating.</li>
  <li>Inspect water trap installation.</li>
  <li>Inspect circuit connections at the absorber block.</li>
  <li>Inspect bag arm and manual ventilation port.</li>
  <li>Inspect sample line connections.</li>
  <li>Listen for hissing sounds during the pressure phase of the test.</li>
  <li>If the pressure will not hold during checkout, a leak is likely present.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Vaporizers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Improperly seated vaporizers frequently cause checkout failure.</li>
  <li>Verify that vaporizers are fully locked into position.</li>
  <li>Ensure only one vaporizer is turned ON.</li>
  <li>Confirm filler caps are secure.</li>
  <li>Inspect for visible damage to mounting seals.</li>
  <li>If unsure, turn vaporizers OFF and repeat checkout.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirm Gas Supply</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure O₂, Air, and N₂O pipeline pressures are within normal range.</li>
  <li>Confirm backup E-cylinders are either properly opened or confirmed full.</li>
  <li>Ensure no gas supply alarms are active.</li>
  <li>Low or missing pipeline pressure can cause checkout failure.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Drain Water Traps</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Excess moisture in flow or pressure sensing lines can affect system testing.</li>
  <li>Check and empty water traps.</li>
  <li>Ensure sample lines are dry.</li>
  <li>Replace sample line if occluded.</li>
  <li>Moisture can cause sensor-related test failures.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reboot and Repeat System Checkout</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Power cycle the unit fully.</li>
  <li>Turn off the machine.</li>
  <li>Wait 30–60 seconds.</li>
  <li>Restart and perform full system checkout again.</li>
  <li>Transient software faults can occasionally cause false failures.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Note Specific Error Message</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Document the exact checkout failure message.</li>
  <li>Leak test failed.</li>
  <li>Flow sensor failure.</li>
  <li>Pressure sensor failure.</li>
  <li>Ventilator test failure.</li>
  <li>Gas module failure.</li>
  <li>The exact failure helps determine whether the issue is external or internal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If circuit setup is correct, no leaks are found, vaporizers are properly seated, gas supply is confirmed, moisture has been addressed, and the machine still fails checkout with the same error, then common external causes have been ruled out.</p>

<p>The issue is likely internal (e.g., flow sensor, pressure transducer, internal valve, or electronic module).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the machine from service.</li>
  <li>Clearly label it Out of Service.</li>
  <li>Arrange for bench evaluation or vendor repair.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary risk and avoids deeper system damage.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never bypass system checkout to place the machine into clinical use.</p>
<p>If checkout cannot be completed successfully:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not use the machine.</li>
  <li>Move the patient to a fully functional anesthesia workstation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anesthesia machines are life-support devices, and a failed checkout indicates a potential safety issue.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“OR staff reported the Aisys anesthesia machine failed system checkout with a ‘Leak Test Failed’ message at startup.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Found loose CO₂ absorber canister and Y-piece not capped during automated leak test. Machine unable to maintain test pressure.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Reseated absorber canister, capped Y-piece, repeated system checkout. Machine passed full checkout and returned to service. Verified no alarms present.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet and pipeline pressures verified</li>
  <li>Vaporizers locked and OFF</li>
  <li>Leak sounds present or absent</li>
  <li>Water trap drained</li>
  <li>Exact error message recorded</li>
  <li>Final checkout status</li>
  <li>Final device status (Returned to service or Sent for repair)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>System checkout failures on anesthesia machines must be approached methodically and safely. Start with simple, external causes—circuit setup, leaks, vaporizers, and gas supply—before assuming internal failure. Protect the patient first, escalate appropriately, and document clearly.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
