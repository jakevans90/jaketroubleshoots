    <h3>Asset Type</h3>
    <p>Pulse Oximeter</p>

    <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
    <p>Masimo</p>

    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>Rad-97</p>

    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses situations where the Masimo Rad-97 touchscreen or control panel:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does not respond to touch or button inputs</li>
      <li>Responds intermittently or erratically</li>
      <li>Freezes, lags, or displays unregistered commands</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The focus is on external, easily verifiable causes first—before assuming internal panel or motherboard failure. Proper troubleshooting prioritizes patient safety and ensures correct documentation of work performed.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Ensure Device is Powered Correctly</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirm the device battery is charged or the power adapter is connected securely.</li>
      <li>A low battery or intermittent power can cause touchscreen malfunction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inspect Screen for Debris or Damage</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean the touchscreen with a soft, lint-free cloth and approved disinfectant.</li>
      <li>Check for cracks, scratches, or residue that might interfere with touch sensitivity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check User Gloves / Protective Covers</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Some medical gloves or screen protectors reduce touchscreen responsiveness.</li>
      <li>Remove any covers and test touch response.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Restart the Device</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform a proper power cycle: turn off, wait 10–15 seconds, and turn back on.</li>
      <li>This can clear temporary software glitches affecting the touchscreen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Verify Software / Settings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Check that the device is running the latest approved firmware version.</li>
      <li>Reset display settings to default if the touchscreen remains unresponsive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inspect External Connections</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure any wired probes or modules are securely attached. Loose connections can sometimes interfere with system responsiveness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Test Basic Input Functions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Press physical buttons (if available) to confirm that non-touch input works.</li>
      <li>If physical buttons work but touch does not, the issue is likely localized to the touchscreen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>External causes have been ruled out. The touchscreen hardware or internal control panel may be defective.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the device from service.</li>
      <li>Label as Out of Service and send for bench evaluation or manufacturer repair.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Knowing when to stop troubleshooting prevents accidental damage and maintains patient safety.</p>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Never attempt to troubleshoot or restart the Rad-97 while it is attached to an active patient.</li>
      <li>Move the patient to another monitor or device first.</li>
      <li>Always confirm backup oxygen saturation monitoring is in place before removing the device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “User reported the Rad-97 touchscreen was unresponsive during patient monitoring.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Observed that the touchscreen did not respond to touch inputs; device powered normally and cables were secure; screen was clean and undamaged.”</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    “Device removed from service, labeled Out of Service, and sent for repair. Patient monitored on alternate device during troubleshooting.”</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Battery level at time of failure</li>
      <li>Firmware version</li>
      <li>Any recent software updates</li>
      <li>Response of physical buttons if present</li>
      <li>Presence of gloves or protective screen covers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Patient safety is the top priority. Logical, stepwise troubleshooting can often resolve touch panel issues without risking internal damage. Knowing when to escalate to repair ensures continued safe monitoring and avoids unnecessary downtime. Accurate documentation ensures traceability and supports maintenance tracking.</p>
    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
