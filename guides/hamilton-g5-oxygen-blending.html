<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Ventilator</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Hamilton</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>G5</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Hamilton G5 ventilator:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displays an FiO₂ reading that does not match the set value</li>
  <li>Alarms for high or low oxygen concentration</li>
  <li>Delivers unexpected oxygen percentages</li>
  <li>Shows FiO₂ drift during ventilation</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus is on ruling out external and easily verifiable causes first—gas supply, connections, setup, and configuration—before assuming internal mixer or sensor failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>1. Confirm Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the ventilator is actively supporting a patient, move the patient to another ventilator before troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>Do not attempt oxygen delivery troubleshooting while the device is in clinical use.</li>
  <li>This prevents unintended hypoxia or hyperoxia during testing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Verify Wall Gas Supply</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm oxygen and air hoses are connected to the correct wall outlets.</li>
  <li>Check that both supplies are fully inserted and locked.</li>
  <li>Confirm wall pressure is within normal range (typically ~50 psi in U.S. facilities).</li>
  <li>If available, connect to a known-good outlet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong><br>
The G5 blends oxygen and medical air internally. If one source is absent, low, or cross-connected, the delivered FiO₂ will not match the set value.</p>

<h4>3. Inspect Gas Hoses and DISS Fittings</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check hoses for kinks, crushing, or damage.</li>
  <li>Inspect DISS fittings for debris or worn washers.</li>
  <li>Swap hoses with known-good hoses if uncertainty exists.</li>
  <li>A partially restricted air line, for example, can result in higher-than-set FiO₂.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Check for Crossed Gas Lines</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm oxygen hose is connected to the oxygen inlet.</li>
  <li>Confirm air hose is connected to the air inlet.</li>
  <li>Trace hoses physically from wall to ventilator if necessary.</li>
  <li>Crossed gas lines are a common external cause of FiO₂ mismatch.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Run the Pre-Use Check / Calibration</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Perform a full system check per facility protocol.</li>
  <li>Allow the ventilator to complete oxygen sensor calibration.</li>
  <li>Observe if any gas supply or blending-related warnings appear.</li>
  <li>If the oxygen sensor calibration fails, this may indicate sensor drift or internal issue.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Verify Oxygen Sensor Status</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check oxygen sensor age and service interval.</li>
  <li>If the sensor is near end-of-life, replace per facility policy.</li>
  <li>After replacement, repeat calibration and verify stability.</li>
  <li>A drifting or expired oxygen sensor can falsely indicate mismatch even when blending is correct.</li>
</ul>

<h4>7. Compare with External Oxygen Analyzer (If Available)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Connect an external calibrated oxygen analyzer to the inspiratory limb.</li>
  <li>Compare displayed FiO₂ with ventilator reading.</li>
  <li>If:</li>
  <li>External analyzer matches the ventilator → likely gas supply issue upstream.</li>
  <li>External analyzer disagrees with ventilator → suspect internal sensor or calibration issue.</li>
  <li>This step helps differentiate measurement error from true blending error.</li>
</ul>

<h4>8. Check for Active Alarms or Messages</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Document any of the following:</li>
  <li>Low O₂ supply alarm</li>
  <li>Air supply alarm</li>
  <li>FiO₂ out-of-range</li>
  <li>Calibration failure</li>
  <li>Alarm behavior can help determine whether the issue is supply-related, sensor-related, or blending-related.</li>
</ul>

<h4>9. Observe Stability Over Time</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Set a fixed FiO₂ (e.g., 50%).</li>
  <li>Monitor reading for drift.</li>
  <li>Check if fluctuations correlate with supply pressure changes.</li>
  <li>Intermittent drift may suggest unstable supply pressure rather than internal failure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gas supplies are verified and stable</li>
  <li>Hoses and fittings are confirmed good</li>
  <li>Oxygen sensor has been replaced or calibrated</li>
  <li>External analyzer confirms mismatch</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the issue is likely internal to the ventilator (e.g., proportional solenoid valves, internal mixer, or flow control components).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the ventilator from service</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service</li>
  <li>Send for bench evaluation or authorized repair</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary risk and avoids inappropriate internal disassembly.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never troubleshoot oxygen blending on an actively ventilated patient.</p>
<p>Always transition the patient to another ventilator before testing gas supply or performing calibrations. Oxygen delivery errors directly affect patient safety and can cause rapid desaturation.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Respiratory therapist reported that the ventilator was set to 40% FiO₂ but displayed 55% and triggered high oxygen alarm.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Air hose was partially kinked behind the equipment boom, restricting air supply and causing higher-than-set oxygen concentration.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Replaced air hose, verified supply pressures, recalibrated oxygen sensor, and confirmed FiO₂ accuracy with external analyzer. Ventilator passed system check and returned to service.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Wall outlet pressures verified</li>
  <li>Hoses swapped with known-good set</li>
  <li>Oxygen sensor age noted</li>
  <li>External analyzer comparison performed</li>
  <li>Final operational status documented</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Oxygen blending issues should always be approached logically: verify supply first, confirm measurement second, and escalate only after external causes are ruled out. Patient safety depends on accurate FiO₂ delivery, and disciplined troubleshooting protects both the patient and the equipment.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
