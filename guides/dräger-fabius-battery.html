<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Anesthesia Machine</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Dräger</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Fabius</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Fabius anesthesia machine reports battery faults, does not hold charge, alarms during power loss, or fails to transition properly to battery/UPS power. The focus is on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes first—such as AC power supply issues, cord problems, outlet problems, or battery age—before assuming internal power supply failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do not troubleshoot while the machine is supporting an active patient unless absolutely necessary.</li>
  <li>If there is a battery or power failure alarm during a case, ensure the patient is safely transitioned to backup ventilation and stable before proceeding.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify AC Power Source</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the power cord is fully seated in both the rear of the Fabius and the wall outlet.</li>
  <li>Check for a secure hospital-grade plug connection.</li>
  <li>Look for any damage to the power cord (cuts, bent prongs, loose strain relief).</li>
  <li>Test the outlet with a known-good device or outlet tester.</li>
  <li><strong>Why this matters:</strong> A poor AC supply prevents the internal battery from charging and may trigger battery alarms.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Power Indicator Lights</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verify the machine indicates AC power present.</li>
  <li>Confirm no facility power interruptions occurred (tripped breaker, switched outlet, power strip).</li>
  <li>If connected to an external UPS, verify the UPS is powered on and not in fault mode.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Simulate Power Loss (When Safe and Off Patient)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>With the unit powered on and not in clinical use, disconnect AC power.</li>
  <li>Confirm the unit transitions to battery power without shutting down.</li>
  <li>Observe for immediate low battery alarms or shutdown.</li>
  <li>If the unit shuts down immediately, suspect battery degradation or internal power supply issues.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Battery Status Indicators</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Review battery charge percentage on the display.</li>
  <li>Note whether the battery appears to charge when AC power is restored.</li>
  <li>If battery percentage remains static or drops quickly, battery capacity is likely diminished.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Consider Battery Age</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Review service records for battery replacement history.</li>
  <li>Internal batteries in anesthesia machines commonly degrade over 2–4 years depending on usage and environment.</li>
  <li>If beyond expected lifespan, battery replacement is appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect for Environmental Factors</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check for excessive heat around the machine.</li>
  <li>Listen for abnormal fan noise.</li>
  <li>Note any burnt smell or unusual heat near the power supply area.</li>
  <li>These may indicate internal power supply or charging circuit concerns.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check External UPS (If Used)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm external UPS runtime is adequate.</li>
  <li>Perform a controlled UPS self-test.</li>
  <li>Replace UPS batteries if they fail load testing.</li>
  <li>Ensure the issue is not external before attributing failure to the anesthesia machine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If AC supply has been verified, cords are intact, outlets are functional, and battery age or performance indicates failure, the issue is likely internal (battery pack failure, charging circuit issue, or internal power supply malfunction).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the device from service.</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service.</li>
  <li>Send for authorized repair or perform bench evaluation per facility policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary risk and protects patient safety.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Battery and UPS troubleshooting should never compromise an active case. Always transition the patient to another anesthesia machine or backup ventilation before performing power-related testing. Power instability during anesthesia delivery is a high-risk condition.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Anesthesia machine alarming for low battery and shuts down when unplugged.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Battery failed load test. Unit powered off immediately when AC disconnected. Battery age 4+ years.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Replaced internal battery pack. Verified proper charging and confirmed successful transition to battery power during simulated power loss test.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested and verified functional</li>
  <li>Power cord inspected</li>
  <li>AC indicator confirmed</li>
  <li>Battery charge percentage noted</li>
  <li>Simulated power loss test performed</li>
  <li>Battery age documented</li>
  <li>Final operational status confirmed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Power reliability is critical in anesthesia delivery. Start with external power sources and simple checks before assuming internal failure. Escalate appropriately when battery integrity or charging circuits are in question. Clear documentation ensures traceability and supports patient safety.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
