    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses situations where the BD Alaris infusion pump triggers occlusion alarms. It focuses on easily verifiable, external causes—such as tubing kinks, connector issues, or pump setup errors—before assuming internal hardware failure. The goal is safe troubleshooting without disturbing a patient or the integrity of the infusion.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Move the patient to an alternative infusion line if possible.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt troubleshooting on an active patient infusion unless it is safe to pause or clamp the line.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check the Tubing Path</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspect the entire length of the IV tubing for kinks, bends, or pinches.</li>
      <li>Ensure the tubing is not trapped under bed rails or medical equipment.</li>
      <li>A kinked or compressed line is the most common cause of occlusion alarms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Verify Pump Cassette Seating</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the pump door and check that the cassette is fully seated and locked.</li>
      <li>Reseat the cassette if necessary; an unseated cassette can trigger occlusion alarms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check the Tubing Connections</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that all connectors, Y-sites, and Luer locks are secure and tight.</li>
      <li>Inspect for partial disconnections, clogged filters, or air bubbles that may impede flow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Assess the Infusion Set</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirm that the correct infusion set is loaded according to pump specifications.</li>
      <li>Some sets have flow sensors that detect backpressure; using an incorrect set may trigger false occlusion alarms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Examine the Pump and Pressure Sensor Area</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Look for any visible obstructions or residue in the area where tubing contacts the pump mechanism.</li>
      <li>Clean or replace the tubing if necessary—never disassemble the pump internals yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check Pump Settings and Alarms</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify the programmed flow rate and pressure limits are appropriate.</li>
      <li>High flow rates or sensitivity settings may cause nuisance occlusion alarms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>All external causes have been ruled out. The pump may have a faulty occlusion sensor or internal tubing mechanism.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the pump from service.</li>
      <li>Label it Out of Service.</li>
      <li>Send it for bench evaluation or repair.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clinical Engineering should avoid further internal troubleshooting to prevent damage or patient risk.</p>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Never attempt to clear an occlusion while the patient is actively infusing critical medications.</li>
      <li>Always have a backup pump or IV line ready.</li>
      <li>Document the alarm and any interventions in the patient record for continuity of care.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Pump alarming occlusion despite no visible obstruction.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Tubing kinked under bedrail and cassette slightly unseated.”</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    “Repositioned tubing, reseated cassette, verified alarm cleared, pump returned to service.”</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Outlet and pump placement checked.</li>
      <li>Cassette properly seated.</li>
      <li>Tubing inspected for kinks, bends, or clogs.</li>
      <li>Pressure alarm history and flow rate settings reviewed.</li>
      <li>Final device status: returned to service or labeled OOS if unresolved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Patient safety is paramount: troubleshooting must start with external, verifiable issues and never compromise active infusions. Proper documentation, logical assessment, and knowing when to escalate are the marks of effective Clinical Engineering.</p>
    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
