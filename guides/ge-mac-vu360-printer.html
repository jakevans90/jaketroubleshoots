  <p>Printer Issue – Not Printing / Poor Print Quality</p>
</section>

<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Electrocardiograph (EKG) Machine</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>GE Healthcare</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>MAC VU360</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a MAC VU360 does not print at all or produces faint, incomplete, or poor-quality ECG printouts.</p>

<p>The focus is on logical, external, and easily verifiable checks before assuming internal printer failure. These steps rule out common consumable and configuration issues while maintaining patient safety and minimizing unnecessary escalation.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the device is actively being used for patient testing, complete or transfer the study to another ECG machine before troubleshooting.</li>
<li>Do not disassemble or manipulate the printer while connected to a patient.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirm Printer Is Enabled</h4>
<ul>
<li>Access the system menu and verify the internal printer function is enabled.</li>
<li>If disabled, enable the printer and initiate a controlled print test.</li>
<li>This rules out configuration-related causes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify Paper Type and Installation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open the printer compartment and confirm:</li>
<li>Correct thermal ECG paper is installed</li>
<li>Paper is loaded in the proper orientation</li>
<li>Paper is not curled, faded, or contaminated</li>
<li>Thermal printers require proper paper orientation; incorrect loading will result in blank output.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect Paper Path and Compartment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Check for:</li>
<li>Torn paper fragments</li>
<li>Dust buildup</li>
<li>Obstructions in the paper feed path</li>
<li>Gently clean with a dry lint-free cloth or compressed air.</li>
<li>Do not use liquid cleaners on the thermal head.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Print Density / Contrast Settings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to print settings and verify density is set to default or appropriate levels.</li>
<li>If output is faint, increase density slightly and re-test.</li>
<li>Reset to default if necessary to rule out user adjustment.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Perform Printer Self-Test</h4>
<ul>
<li>Access the internal printer self-test through the system menu.</li>
<li>Observe:</li>
<li>Does paper feed properly?</li>
<li>Is the test pattern clear and complete?</li>
<li>Is output blank despite correct paper?</li>
<li>If the self-test fails or prints poorly, this indicates likely internal printer or thermal head failure.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check for System Error Messages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Review the display for printer-related error codes.</li>
<li>Document exact wording of the message.</li>
<li>Do not attempt board-level repair based on codes; this is for documentation and escalation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>If the printer still does not function after verifying settings, paper supply, density, cleaning, and performing a self-test, common external causes have been ruled out.</p>

<p>The issue is likely internal (thermal print head, feed motor, internal printer assembly, or connection issue).</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the device from clinical service</li>
<li>Label it Out of Service</li>
<li>Send the unit for bench evaluation or authorized repair</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary downtime and protects equipment integrity.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<p>Never troubleshoot printer components while a patient is actively being tested. If documentation is urgently needed, move the patient to another ECG machine and complete the study there. Troubleshooting should only occur when patient care is not impacted.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“ECG prints blank pages.”<br>
or<br>
“Printout is very faint and unreadable.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Printer enabled and correct thermal paper loaded. Density adjusted with no improvement. Printer self-test prints blank output. Suspected thermal print head failure.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Removed unit from service and sent for repair.”<br>
“Printer assembly replaced on bench. Self-test passed. Returned to service.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paper type verified</li>
<li>Paper orientation confirmed</li>
<li>Density setting checked</li>
<li>Printer self-test result</li>
<li>Error messages displayed</li>
<li>Paper feed behavior</li>
<li>Final device status (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Printer issues are frequently caused by consumables, configuration, or simple mechanical obstructions. A methodical approach that starts with external checks prevents unnecessary escalation and supports accurate repair decisions. Clear documentation ensures continuity of care and proper follow-up.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
