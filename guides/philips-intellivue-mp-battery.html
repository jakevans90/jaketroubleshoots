  <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
  <p>This guide addresses situations where an IntelliVue MP Series monitor fails to operate on its internal battery, does not hold a charge, or shows battery errors. The focus is on simple, external, and verifiable causes first, such as power connections, battery seating, or charger issues, before assuming internal battery or board failure.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h4>Verify AC Power Supply</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the monitor is plugged into a live wall outlet.</li>
    <li>Check the outlet with another device to confirm power availability.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> A lack of AC power will prevent battery charging and trigger battery warnings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Inspect Power Cord and Connector</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Examine the power cord for cuts, frays, or loose connections.</li>
    <li>Ensure the connector seats fully in the monitor’s AC input.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Poor connection can prevent charging or cause false battery errors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Check Monitor Battery Status</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Navigate to the monitor’s battery menu to view charge level and status.</li>
    <li>Confirm the monitor recognizes the battery.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Misconfigured settings or disabled battery support can mimic failure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Examine Battery Condition</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the battery and inspect for swelling, leakage, or corrosion.</li>
    <li>Re-seat the battery, ensuring it locks into place.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Poor contact or damaged batteries can prevent operation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Test Monitor with a Known Good Battery</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If a verified spare battery is available, install it and test functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Isolates whether the issue is with the battery or the monitor itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Observe Indicator Lights / Messages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Record any battery icons, error codes, or warnings.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> These messages often pinpoint the source of the problem.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
  <p>External causes have been ruled out. The battery may be internally failed, or the monitor’s charging circuit may be compromised.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the monitor from service.</li>
    <li>Label as “Out of Service.”</li>
    <li>Send for bench evaluation or Philips service.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting.</p>

  <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
  <p>Do not troubleshoot the battery while the monitor is connected to a patient. If monitoring is required, move the patient to a unit with verified power and battery function first.</p>

  <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
  <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  “Monitor battery fails to hold charge and shows error.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  “Battery seated properly but monitor does not recognize it; AC power confirmed good; spare battery tested with same results.”</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
  “Monitor removed from service, labeled Out of Service, sent to Philips service for evaluation.”</p>

  <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Outlet tested: ✅/❌</li>
    <li>Power cord inspected: ✅/❌</li>
    <li>Indicator lights or error codes: Record exact messages</li>
    <li>External battery tested: ✅/❌</li>
    <li>Final device status: Out of Service</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>Patient safety comes first. Troubleshooting battery issues should always begin with external checks before assuming internal failure. Document all findings carefully and escalate appropriately. Correct labeling and removal from service prevent patient harm and ensure proper repair.</p>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
