</section>

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Infusion Pump</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>BD</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Alaris</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>

<p>This guide addresses situations where the BD Alaris infusion pump:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will not power on when unplugged</li>
  <li>Shuts down immediately after being removed from AC power</li>
  <li>Indicates low battery despite extended charging</li>
  <li>Will not power on at all</li>
</ul>

<p>The focus is on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes first—such as AC power source issues, power cords, battery charging conditions, and module seating—before assuming internal battery or power supply failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Ensure the Patient Is Safe</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the pump is in active use, move the patient to another functioning pump first.</li>
  <li>Do not troubleshoot a power issue on a live infusion.</li>
  <li>Patient safety always comes before device evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify AC Power Source</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the outlet is functional (test with another device or outlet tester).</li>
  <li>Avoid switched outlets.</li>
  <li>Ensure the hospital-grade power cord is fully inserted into both:</li>
  <li>The wall outlet</li>
  <li>The rear of the pump PC unit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong><br>
If the pump is not truly receiving AC power, the battery will not charge and may appear defective.</p>

<h4>Check AC Indicator Lights</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm AC power indicator is illuminated on the pump.</li>
  <li>If no AC indicator is present:</li>
  <li>Swap the power cord with a known-good cord.</li>
  <li>Move to a known-good outlet.</li>
  <li>If AC is restored and the unit powers on, the issue was external (cord or outlet).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Attempt Power-On with AC Connected</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Connect to verified AC power.</li>
  <li>Attempt to power on the PC unit.</li>
  <li>If the unit does not power on even with confirmed AC power:</li>
  <li>Suspect internal power supply failure.</li>
  <li>Remove from service.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Allow Adequate Charge Time</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the pump powers on while plugged in but shuts down when unplugged:</li>
  <li>Leave the pump plugged into AC for at least 4–6 hours.</li>
  <li>Confirm battery indicator increases appropriately.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong><br>
Deeply discharged batteries may require extended charge time before stabilizing.</p>

<h4>Inspect for Physical Clues</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check for:</li>
  <li>Excessive heat near battery area</li>
  <li>Burn smell</li>
  <li>Swollen casing</li>
  <li>Corrosion near battery compartment</li>
  <li>Repeated low-battery alarms</li>
  <li>Any of these suggest internal battery failure.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirm Module Seating (if applicable)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure infusion modules are properly seated to the PC unit.</li>
  <li>Remove and reseat modules.</li>
  <li>Attempt power cycle again.</li>
  <li>Improper module seating can occasionally create abnormal power behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Perform Battery Test (If Supported by Facility Policy)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If your department performs battery capacity tests during PM:</li>
  <li>Run a controlled discharge test.</li>
  <li>Compare runtime to manufacturer specification.</li>
  <li>If runtime is significantly below spec, battery replacement is indicated.</li>
  <li>Do not open the unit unless authorized for internal battery replacement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>

<p>If:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AC power is verified</li>
  <li>Power cord is confirmed good</li>
  <li>The unit will not power on with AC</li>
  <li>or</li>
  <li>The battery will not hold charge after adequate charging time</li>
</ul>

<p>The likely causes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internal battery failure</li>
  <li>Internal power supply board failure</li>
  <li>Charging circuit failure</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the device from service</li>
  <li>Label it Out of Service</li>
  <li>Send to the shop for bench evaluation or authorized battery replacement</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop external troubleshooting is proper Clinical Engineering practice.</p>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>

<p>Never attempt to troubleshoot a suspected battery failure on an active infusion.</p>

<p>If a pump shuts down unexpectedly on battery, immediately transfer the patient to a functioning device before evaluating the unit.</p>

<p>Power instability presents a direct patient safety risk.</p>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Nursing reports pump shuts off when unplugged and will not run on battery.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
Unit powered on with AC present but shut down immediately when disconnected. After 6-hour charge, battery runtime was less than 2 minutes. Battery failed capacity check.</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
Removed from service. Replaced internal battery per department policy. Verified normal battery charge and runtime. Returned to service.</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested</li>
  <li>Power cord swapped</li>
  <li>AC indicator status</li>
  <li>Battery charge indicator behavior</li>
  <li>Approximate runtime on battery</li>
  <li>Any heat or odor observed</li>
  <li>Final operational status</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>

<p>Power-related complaints should always begin with simple verification of AC source and connections before assuming internal failure. Many battery complaints originate from outlet or cord issues. Once external causes are ruled out, prompt removal from service protects patients and prevents unexpected infusion interruption. Proper documentation ensures trend tracking and lifecycle management.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
