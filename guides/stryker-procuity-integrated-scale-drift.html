    <h3>Asset Type</h3>

    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses situations where the integrated scale on the Stryker ProCuity bed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shows weight readings that drift over time</li>
      <li>Displays inconsistent measurements between uses</li>
      <li>Fails to stabilize at a correct weight</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The focus is on external, logical troubleshooting first—connections, calibration, and environmental factors—before assuming internal scale failure.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Verify Bed is on a Level Surface</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the bed is placed on a flat, stable floor.</li>
      <li>Uneven surfaces can cause scale readings to drift.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Check for Obstructions or Load on the Bed</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove any items on the mattress except the patient (if safe) or test weight.</li>
      <li>Make sure side rails or accessories are not applying uneven pressure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Inspect Power Connection and Battery Status</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirm the bed is properly plugged in if the scale requires mains power.</li>
      <li>If the bed uses battery backup, ensure batteries are charged.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Confirm Calibration Status</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Review the bed’s scale calibration logs if available.</li>
      <li>Some models allow a manual recalibration; follow manufacturer prompts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Perform a Zero or Tare Function</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Activate the scale’s zero/tare function with no weight on the bed.</li>
      <li>Observe if the scale stabilizes or continues to drift.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Environmental Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure temperature and humidity are within recommended ranges.</li>
      <li>Vibrations from nearby equipment can cause drifting readings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Swap Mattress or Mattress Support Pads</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>If the bed uses specialized pads or mattress sensors, remove and reseat them.</li>
      <li>Check for uneven wear or compression affecting weight distribution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>If scale drift continues after external checks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the bed from clinical use.</li>
      <li>Label as Out of Service.</li>
      <li>Contact Stryker service or authorized repair personnel for bench evaluation or scale replacement.</li>
      <li>Avoid further use until verified safe, as unreliable weight readings can affect medication dosing, patient monitoring, and safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not rely on the scale for patient weight when readings are inconsistent.</li>
      <li>Move the patient to another bed with a functioning scale before attempting procedures that require accurate weight.</li>
      <li>Document all observations and actions taken before escalation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Integrated scale shows drifting weight readings and fails to stabilize.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Bed on uneven surface; calibration may be out of spec; potential mattress sensor issue.”</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    “Verified surface, cleared obstructions, performed zero/tare, reseated mattress sensors; bed removed from service and sent for calibration/repair.”</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bed location and floor type</li>
      <li>Battery status and power connection</li>
      <li>Zero/tare attempts and results</li>
      <li>Any unusual noises or resistance from bed mechanisms</li>
      <li>Environmental factors (temperature, vibration)</li>
      <li>Final status before sending for repair</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Patient safety requires that weight measurements are accurate and reliable. Logical, stepwise troubleshooting—starting with simple external checks and escalating appropriately—ensures that potential risks are mitigated and proper documentation supports follow-up and maintenance.</p>
    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
