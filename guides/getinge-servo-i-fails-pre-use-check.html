    <p>Fails Pre-Use Check / "Leak Detected"</p>

    <h3>Asset Type</h3>

    <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
    <p>Getinge</p>

    <h3>Model</h3>
    <p>Servo-i</p>

    <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
    <p>This guide addresses situations where a Getinge Servo-i ventilator fails its pre-use check and reports a “Leak Detected” error. The focus is on external and easily verifiable causes—such as breathing circuits, patient connectors, tubing, and accessories—before assuming internal hardware failure. The goal is to restore safe operation for patient use.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h4>Ensure Device Is Powered and Stable</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify the ventilator is plugged into a functional outlet.</li>
      <li>Check that the battery (if present) is charged and the unit is powered on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why: Low or unstable power can cause false leak detection.</p>

    <h4>Inspect the Breathing Circuit</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure all tubing (inspiratory and expiratory limbs) is correctly connected.</li>
      <li>Confirm that tubing is free of kinks, cracks, or holes.</li>
      <li>Remove and reconnect tubing to ensure secure connections.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why: Even a small disconnection or crack can trigger a leak alarm.</p>

    <h4>Check the Patient Interface</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspect the endotracheal tube, mask, or other patient connector.</li>
      <li>Ensure the device is properly attached with no loose connections.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why: Leaks often occur at the interface rather than inside the ventilator.</p>

    <h4>Inspect the Exhalation Valve / Humidifier</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove or check the exhalation valve for proper seating.</li>
      <li>If a heated humidifier is attached, confirm all connections are tight and tubing is intact.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why: A misaligned valve or humidifier connection can mimic a leak.</p>

    <h4>Verify the Circuit Type Selected in Software</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the ventilator software settings match the connected circuit (adult, pediatric, neonatal).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why: Mismatched settings can cause pre-use check failures.</p>

    <h4>Perform a Manual Leak Test</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Disconnect from the patient.</li>
      <li>Close the circuit as recommended in the user interface.</li>
      <li>Run the ventilator’s “circuit check” or leak test again.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why: Confirms whether the leak is in the patient circuit or the ventilator.</p>

    <h4>Replace Consumable Components if Needed</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Swap out disposable circuits or valves with known-good units.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why: Consumables are common sources of leaks and are easily replaced without opening the ventilator.</p>

    <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
    <p>Common external causes have been ruled out. The ventilator may have an internal leak or valve malfunction.</p>
    <p>Action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the ventilator from service.</li>
      <li>Label it Out of Service.</li>
      <li>Send for bench evaluation or repair by authorized service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Knowing when to stop troubleshooting is proper Clinical Engineering practice.</p>

    <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
    <p>Do not attempt on a patient: Always ensure the ventilator is removed from patient care during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p>Use an alternative ventilator if available to maintain patient safety.</p>
    <p>Troubleshoot only when safe and in accordance with hospital protocols.</p>

    <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
    <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

    <h4>Complaint</h4>
    <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    “Pre-use check fails with ‘Leak Detected’ message.”</p>

    <h4>Cause</h4>
    <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em><br>
    Observed loose circuit connection at inspiratory limb. No cracks in tubing, valves seated correctly, no patient connected. Leak persisted after reconnecting.</p>

    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
    Replaced disposable breathing circuit with a verified functional circuit. Pre-use check passed successfully. Ventilator returned to service.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Outlet tested: ✔</li>
      <li>Tubing inspected and swapped: ✔</li>
      <li>Exhalation valve checked: ✔</li>
      <li>Software circuit type verified: ✔</li>
      <li>Leak test results: ✔</li>
      <li>Final device status: Functional, returned to service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>Patient safety must always come first. Start troubleshooting from external, easily verifiable causes, escalate when necessary, and document every step clearly. Proper logic-based troubleshooting saves time, prevents unnecessary repairs, and ensures safe patient care.</p>
    <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
