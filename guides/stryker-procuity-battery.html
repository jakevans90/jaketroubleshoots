  <p>Battery Not Charging</p>

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Hospital Bed</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>Stryker</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>ProCuity</p>

<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide addresses situations where the Stryker ProCuity bed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does not hold or charge its battery</li>
  <li>Shows low battery warnings despite being plugged in</li>
  <li>Fails to operate in battery-powered mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Focus is on external checks and simple logical troubleshooting before assuming internal battery or charger failure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

<h4>Verify Power Source</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the bed is plugged into a known working wall outlet.</li>
  <li>Test the outlet with another device to confirm it has power.</li>
  <li><em>Why it matters:</em> A dead outlet is the most common cause of a non-charging battery.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check Bed Connection to Charger</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the bed’s charging cable is fully inserted and free of damage.</li>
  <li>Inspect for bent pins, broken connectors, or frayed wires.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect Indicator Lights</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Look for charging LEDs on the bed or battery.</li>
  <li>Confirm that the charging light is on and steady.</li>
  <li>Flashing or no light can indicate battery or charger issues.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Battery Seating</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove and reseat the battery to ensure proper contact.</li>
  <li>Listen or feel for a click to confirm secure installation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Swap with Known Good Battery</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If available, insert a charged battery from another ProCuity bed.</li>
  <li>If it charges, the original battery is likely faulty.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Swap Charger/Cradle if Possible</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If a spare charger or docking station is available, test with the same bed.</li>
  <li>Confirms whether the problem is the charger or the battery/bed connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<p>External checks have been exhausted; the battery or internal charging circuitry may be defective.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the bed from service.</li>
  <li>Label as “Out of Service.”</li>
  <li>Send the battery or bed for repair or bench evaluation.</li>
  <li>Recognize that stopping here is proper troubleshooting—do not attempt internal repair unless trained and authorized.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not rely on battery power for patient transfers until resolved.</li>
  <li>Move patients to a bed with verified working power before troubleshooting.</li>
  <li>Always ensure patient safety first.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
<p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Bed will not charge; battery warning light remains on.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Battery did not accept charge; charger and outlet confirmed functional.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em><br>
“Battery removed, tested, and replaced with spare; defective battery labeled and sent for service.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Outlet tested: Yes</li>
  <li>Charger tested: Yes</li>
  <li>Battery LED indicators: Flashing/Off</li>
  <li>Unusual sounds or heat: None noted</li>
  <li>Final bed status: Replaced battery; bed operational</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Patient safety is paramount. Using logical, stepwise checks ensures external causes are ruled out before internal repair is assumed. Proper documentation and escalation protect both patients and staff while maintaining reliable equipment.</p>
<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
