  <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
  <p>This guide addresses situations where a Hillrom Progressa bed fails to respond to control inputs, moves intermittently, or stops functioning entirely. The focus is on external, easily verifiable causes—such as power connections, user controls, and actuator obstruction—before assuming internal pump or electronics failure. Patient safety and proper escalation are emphasized.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h4>Verify Power Connection</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the bed is plugged into a live outlet or that its battery is charged.</li>
    <li>Check that the bed’s power cord is intact and fully seated.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Intermittent function is often caused by loose connections or depleted batteries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Check Bed Control Handset and Panel</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Inspect the handset for visible damage, frayed wires, or stuck buttons.</li>
    <li>Test all functions to see if some movements work while others don’t.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> A malfunctioning handset can mimic pump failure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Inspect Fuses and Circuit Breakers</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Locate and check the bed’s internal fuses or reset any circuit breakers on the bed.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> A blown fuse can prevent the pump from running or limit certain functions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Observe Mechanical Movement</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure no bed rails, linens, or accessories are obstructing actuator movement.</li>
    <li>Check that wheels are properly locked/unlocked depending on intended movement.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Mechanical obstructions can prevent the bed from moving even if the pump is working.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Test Battery (if applicable)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If the bed has a battery pack, verify charge using the built-in indicator.</li>
    <li>Swap with a known-good battery if available.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Weak batteries often cause intermittent operation or slow movement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Listen for Pump Motor Activation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Press a function button and listen for any motor sound.</li>
    <li>No sound may indicate electrical/pump failure.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Confirms whether the issue is electrical or mechanical.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Inspect Wiring and Connections</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Check cables between the pump, handset, and motor assembly for loose or disconnected plugs.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> Disconnected or damaged wires are a common cause of intermittent operation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
  <p>External causes have been ruled out. The issue is likely internal to the pump or electronics.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the bed from service.</li>
    <li>Label as “Out of Service.”</li>
    <li>Send for repair or bench evaluation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting and ensures patient safety.</p>

  <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
  <p>Do not attempt to move patients on a bed that operates intermittently—risk of sudden collapse exists.</p>
  <p>Transfer the patient to a safe, functional bed before troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>Only troubleshoot when it is safe to do so and when the patient is secured.</p>

  <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
  <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  Bed fails to respond to handset commands; functions intermittently.</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  Bed confirmed plugged in; handset buttons tested; no visible obstructions; fuses intact; pump motor silent.</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
  Bed removed from service, labeled Out of Service, and sent for repair.</p>

  <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Outlet tested and verified live</li>
    <li>Handset tested, buttons observed</li>
    <li>Fuses/circuit breakers checked</li>
    <li>Battery indicator checked</li>
    <li>Bed movement obstruction inspected</li>
    <li>Motor activation attempted, no sound heard</li>
    <li>Final device status: Out of Service</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>Effective troubleshooting balances logic, safety, and escalation. Always start with simple, external checks before assuming internal failure. Proper documentation ensures continuity of care and supports repair or replacement decisions.</p>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
