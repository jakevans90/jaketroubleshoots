<h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a Verathon Prime Plus bladder scanner exhibits touchscreen or display issues. The focus is on simple, external checks that are most commonly associated with display problems, such as power, connections, or screen contamination, before assuming internal failure.</p>
<p>These steps prioritize patient safety, proper escalation, and accurate CCR documentation.</p>

<h4>Power Check</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the device is fully charged or connected to AC power.</li>
  <li>Verify the battery status indicator is normal.</li>
  <li><em>Why:</em> A low battery or intermittent power can cause touchscreen responsiveness issues or blank screens.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect Cables and Connectors</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Check for loose or damaged AC adapters, docking station connectors, and probe connections.</li>
  <li>Re-seat all cables securely.</li>
  <li><em>Why:</em> Loose connections can prevent the display from initializing correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Clean the Touchscreen</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use a soft, lint-free cloth dampened with water or approved screen cleaner.</li>
  <li>Avoid abrasive materials or excessive moisture.</li>
  <li><em>Why:</em> Oils, dirt, or debris can block touch input or create ghost touches.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Restart the Device</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Power off completely, wait 10–15 seconds, then power on.</li>
  <li>Observe the display during boot for abnormalities.</li>
  <li><em>Why:</em> Temporary software glitches often resolve with a restart.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check for Physical Damage</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Inspect the touchscreen for cracks, deep scratches, or liquid ingress.</li>
  <li><em>Why:</em> Physical damage can permanently affect touchscreen performance or display visibility.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Test in Alternate Settings</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use a different AC outlet or battery pack if available.</li>
  <li>Try a known-good docking station or cable.</li>
  <li><em>Why:</em> Confirms whether the issue is with the scanner or its external power interface.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Soft Reset / Factory Reset (if applicable and safe)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Only perform if safe and documented according to manufacturer guidelines.</li>
  <li><em>Why:</em> Corrupted settings can cause display or touch issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Common external causes have been ruled out.</li>
  <li>The device should be:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Removed from service</li>
      <li>Labeled Out of Service</li>
      <li>Sent to Verathon-approved repair or internal bench evaluation</li>
    </ul>
  <li><em>Note:</em> Knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting; avoid internal repairs beyond your scope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Patient Safety: Do not attempt scans on patients if the touchscreen is unresponsive; this could lead to inaccurate bladder volume readings.</li>
  <li>Move the patient to a known-working device first.</li>
  <li>Only troubleshoot when the scanner is not in active use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
<p>Touchscreen is unresponsive or display intermittently blank.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Display freezes when attempting to select patient profile; touchscreen does not respond to input.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Observed: Device fully charged, cables intact, screen clean, but unresponsive; no physical damage noted.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
Suspected internal touchscreen controller or display issue after external checks.</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p>Action taken: Device removed from service, labeled Out of Service, sent for manufacturer evaluation.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em><br>
“Prime Plus scanner returned to Biomedical Engineering for vendor repair; patient scanned using alternate device.”</p>

<h2>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Battery charge level at the time of issue</li>
  <li>Any recent drops or liquid exposure</li>
  <li>Device software version</li>
  <li>Response to restart or reset</li>
  <li>Any error codes displayed</li>
  <li>Docking station or cable used</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>Effective troubleshooting prioritizes patient safety, starts with logical and simple external checks, and ensures proper documentation. By knowing when to escalate, you prevent unnecessary internal intervention and preserve device integrity.</p>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
