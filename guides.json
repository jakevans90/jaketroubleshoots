Remove the affected unit from the crash cart. Self-test and battery troubleshooting should never be performed on an active emergency device."

If plugged into a power strip, isolation transformer, or UPS, verify that device is powered on and functioning. If available, try a different known-working wall outlet.

At this point, the issue is likely internal (power supply board, internal fuse, or power distribution failure). Remove the monitor from service, label clearly as Out of Service, and send for repair or bench evaluation. Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary downtime and protects patient safety.
