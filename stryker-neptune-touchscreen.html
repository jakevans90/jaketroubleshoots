  <h3>Manufacturer</h3>

  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>Neptune</p>

  <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
  <p>
    This guide addresses situations where the Stryker Neptune touchscreen or control panel becomes unresponsive, freezes, lags, or does not register button selections.
  </p>
  <p>
    The focus is on external and easily verifiable causes first—such as power quality, system overload, environmental factors, and simple software resets—before assuming internal display or main board failure.
  </p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h4>1. Ensure the Device Is Not Actively Connected to a Patient</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Before troubleshooting, confirm the unit is not in active use.</li>
    <li>If connected, transfer suction to another device first.</li>
    <li>Freezing during a case can create safety risk if suction control cannot be adjusted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Perform a Controlled Power Cycle</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Many touchscreen freezes are software-related.</li>
    <li>Turn the unit off using the normal shutdown procedure.</li>
    <li>Wait at least 60 seconds.</li>
    <li>Disconnect from AC power.</li>
    <li>Reconnect power and restart the unit.</li>
    <li><strong>Why this matters:</strong> A full power cycle clears temporary software faults and resets the control interface.</li>
    <li>If the touchscreen functions normally after restart, monitor for recurrence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Verify Stable Power Source</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Is the unit plugged directly into a wall outlet?</li>
    <li>Avoid extension cords or power strips.</li>
    <li>Test the outlet with an outlet tester or known working device.</li>
    <li>Inspect the power cord for damage.</li>
    <li>Unstable or fluctuating voltage can cause control board instability and display freezing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Inspect the Touchscreen Surface</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Check for fluid residue.</li>
    <li>Check for cleaning chemical buildup.</li>
    <li>Check for cracks in the screen.</li>
    <li>Check for physical pressure points.</li>
    <li>Wipe the screen with approved cleaning solution and lint-free cloth.</li>
    <li>Excess fluid infiltration around the bezel can interfere with capacitive or resistive touch response.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Observe System Behavior During Freeze</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the display remain lit?</li>
    <li>Do physical buttons respond?</li>
    <li>Are suction motors still functioning?</li>
    <li>Are alarm tones active?</li>
    <li>If suction continues but screen is frozen, the issue is likely interface-related rather than full system failure.</li>
    <li>If the entire unit becomes unresponsive, suspect deeper power or control board issue.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6. Check for Environmental Factors</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluate excessive OR humidity.</li>
    <li>Check for fluid spills near the control panel.</li>
    <li>Assess heat exposure.</li>
    <li>Determine if terminal cleaning was recently completed.</li>
    <li>Moisture intrusion is a common cause of intermittent panel freezing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>7. Check for Recurring Pattern</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Does freezing occur only during high suction load?</li>
    <li>Only during startup?</li>
    <li>After prolonged use?</li>
    <li>Document pattern behavior.</li>
    <li>Intermittent freezing that worsens over time often indicates control board degradation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>8. Inspect for Error Messages After Reboot</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>After restarting, look for boot-up warnings.</li>
    <li>Look for system faults.</li>
    <li>Look for software errors.</li>
    <li>Record any displayed codes before clearing them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
  <p>
    If the touchscreen continues freezing after verified stable power, controlled power cycle, screen inspection, and environmental check, then common external causes have been ruled out.
  </p>
  <p>
    The issue is likely internal to the display assembly, control board, or software module.
  </p>
  <p>The device should be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Removed from service</li>
    <li>Labeled Out of Service</li>
    <li>Sent for bench evaluation or manufacturer repair</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary downtime and protects patient safety.
  </p>

  <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
  <p>
    Do not troubleshoot a frozen Neptune while it is connected to an active surgical case.
  </p>
  <p>
    Transfer suction to another unit first.
  </p>
  <p>
    Loss of suction control during surgery presents a significant risk.
  </p>

  <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

  <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  “Touchscreen froze during procedure. Could not adjust suction level.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  “Unit powered on but touchscreen unresponsive. Power cycle temporarily restored function. Issue recurred after 20 minutes of operation.”</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
  “Removed unit from service. Verified stable power source. Labeled Out of Service and sent for further evaluation of control board/display assembly.”</p>

  <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Outlet tested and verified</li>
    <li>Power cord condition</li>
    <li>Whether suction motor remained functional</li>
    <li>Any error codes observed</li>
    <li>Evidence of fluid intrusion</li>
    <li>Final device status</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>
    Touchscreen freezing is often software or power related before it is hardware failure. Logical, external checks prevent unnecessary part replacement and downtime. When freezing becomes recurrent or unpredictable, removing the device from service is the correct and safe decision.
  </p>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
