  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Check Power Source",
      "instructions": "Confirm the wall outlet is live by testing with another device (lamp, multimeter, etc.). Verify no GFCI outlets have tripped. Why: A dead outlet or tripped breaker is a common cause of “no power” issues."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect Power Cord and Plug",
      "instructions": "Check the power cord for cuts, kinks, or burn marks. Ensure the plug is fully seated in the outlet. Why: Damaged cords prevent the device from receiving power safely."
    },
    {
      "title": "Confirm Power Switch Position",
      "instructions": "Ensure the main power switch is turned on (some units require pressing and holding). Why: Users sometimes forget the switch position."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check Fuse or Circuit Breaker (if accessible)",
      "instructions": "Some UC1800 units have an internal fuse accessible via a fuse holder. Verify the fuse is intact; replace with manufacturer-specified fuse if blown. Why: A blown fuse is a safety measure that prevents device operation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reset the Unit (if applicable)",
      "instructions": "Some models have a reset button or power cycle procedure. Disconnect from power for 1–2 minutes, then reconnect and attempt start. Why: Power interruptions or minor faults can require a reset to clear."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for Visible Signs of Damage",
      "instructions": "Inspect the control panel and housing for burn marks, melted components, or liquid ingress. Why: Physical damage may indicate internal fault or unsafe conditions."

    "CCR": {
      "Complaint": "UC1800 ultrasonic cleaner won’t power on.",
      "Cause": "Verified outlet is live; power cord intact; fuse intact; unit still unresponsive.",

  "dateAdded": "2026-02-24",
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Verify Power and Controls",
      "instructions": "Ensure the unit is plugged into a properly grounded outlet. Confirm the power switch is on and the display is functioning. Check that the timer and power settings are correct. Why: The cleaner cannot operate effectively if it’s not receiving full power or is set incorrectly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check Water Level",
      "instructions": "Ensure the water level is above the minimum fill line and below the maximum. Low water reduces ultrasonic cavitation, which diminishes cleaning performance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect Cleaning Solution",
      "instructions": "Confirm you are using the correct ultrasonic cleaning solution recommended for the items being cleaned. Replace solution if it is dirty, contaminated, or has been used multiple times. Why: Dirty or inappropriate solutions absorb ultrasonic energy, reducing cleaning effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check Water Temperature",
      "instructions": "Verify the water temperature is within the recommended range (typically 30–50°C for general cleaning). Cold water can reduce ultrasonic activity, while overly hot water can damage some instruments."
    },
    {
      "title": "Assess Load Size and Arrangement",
      "instructions": "Ensure items are not touching each other or the tank walls. Avoid overloading the tank; too many items can block ultrasonic waves. Why: Proper spacing allows uniform cavitation and improves cleaning efficiency."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for Tank Contamination or Deposits",
      "instructions": "Check for scale, debris, or residue on the tank bottom. Clean the tank with a soft cloth and mild detergent if needed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for Air Bubbles and Degassing",
      "instructions": "When adding fresh solution, run the unit briefly to degas water (usually 2–3 minutes). Air bubbles reduce ultrasonic energy transmission."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test Ultrasonic Function",
      "instructions": "Use the “foil test” (placing a small piece of aluminum foil in the tank and running a short cycle). Even pitting on the foil indicates proper ultrasonic activity. Why: Confirms whether the transducers are generating ultrasonic waves correctly."
    }
  ],
  "documentation": {
    "CCR": {
      "Complaint": "UC1800 not cleaning instruments effectively; residue remains after standard cycle.",
      "Cause": "Water level low, solution dirty, and items crowded in tank; ultrasonic energy not optimally delivered.",
      "Resolution": "Refilled tank to proper level, replaced solution, rearranged items for spacing, ran degassing cycle; cleaning performance restored."

      "title": "Water Level and Quality",
      "instructions": "Ensure the tank is filled to the minimum and maximum levels. Confirm water is clean; overly dirty solution can trigger error codes. Why: The UC1800 has sensors that detect fluid presence and conductivity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Temperature Sensor Check",
      "instructions": "If equipped, confirm the heater sensor is fully immersed in water. Look for bent or disconnected probes. Why: Dry operation or sensor misalignment can trigger error codes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Connection and Cable Inspection",
      "instructions": "Inspect all internal and external connectors for corrosion, moisture, or looseness. Verify that any removable sensor connectors are seated properly. Why: Loose or dirty connections are a common cause of sensor faults."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cleaning Cycle Reset",
      "instructions": "Power cycle the unit (turn OFF → wait 30 seconds → turn ON). Try starting a basic cleaning cycle without ultrasonic power (if possible). Why: Software glitches may clear with a simple reset."
    },
    {
      "title": "Solution Conductivity",
      "instructions": "Ensure the cleaning solution is compatible with the UC1800. Avoid using pure water without proper ultrasonic detergent. Why: Incorrect solution conductivity may trigger sensor fault codes."

  "documentation": {
    "CCR": {
      "Complaint": "UC1800 displays sensor error E02 and will not start cleaning cycle.",
      "Cause": "Observed water level below minimum; heater sensor partially lifted out of solution.",
