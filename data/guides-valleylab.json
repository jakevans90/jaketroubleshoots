  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Ensure Patient Safety First",
      "instructions": "Do not troubleshoot while the ESU is connected to an active patient. Confirm the patient has been transitioned to another ESU if surgery is ongoing. Verify the generator is in standby mode before making adjustments. This prevents unintended activation and protects the patient."
    },
    {
      "title": "Verify Return Electrode Is Properly Applied",
      "instructions": "Confirm the pad is fully adhered to clean, dry, hair-free skin. Check for partial lifting, wrinkles, or air pockets. Ensure correct pad placement over a large, well-vascularized muscle mass. Poor pad contact is the most common cause of REM alarms. If the pad appears compromised, replace it with a new one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Confirm Correct Pad Type",
      "instructions": "Verify that a split (REM-compatible) return electrode is being used. Ensure it is compatible with the Valleylab Force FX REM system. Using a solid (non-split) pad or incompatible pad will trigger alarms and prevent activation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the Return Electrode Cable",
      "instructions": "Check for bent pins, loose connectors, or damaged insulation. Ensure the connector is fully seated in the return electrode port. Wiggle the connector gently to see if the alarm clears or intermittently changes. If damage is noted, replace the cable and retest."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swap with a Known-Good Cable",
      "instructions": "Disconnect the current return electrode cable. Connect a known-good cable. Attach to a new pad (not the existing one). If the alarm clears, the issue was likely cable-related."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for Fluid Contamination",
      "instructions": "Inspect the return electrode port for saline, prep solution, or debris. Ensure the connector is dry and free of contamination. Moisture can interfere with REM sensing and cause persistent alarms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Power Cycle the Unit",
      "instructions": "Turn the unit off. Wait 30–60 seconds. Restart and observe whether the alarm persists. Transient REM circuit faults may clear with a reset."
    },
    {
      "title": "Perform Functional Test (Without Patient)",
      "instructions": "Using a test pad or simulator (if available), connect the return electrode. Verify the REM indicator shows normal status. Attempt activation into an ESU analyzer. If the alarm persists with known-good accessories and no patient involved, the issue is likely internal."

  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Ensure Patient Safety First",
      "instructions": "Confirm the ESU is not connected to an active patient. If output is in question during a case, have clinical staff transition to a backup generator immediately before troubleshooting. This prevents unintended injury or surgical delay."
    },
    {
      "title": "Verify Power to the Unit",
      "instructions": "Confirm the unit is plugged into a known-good outlet. Check for proper power-on indicators. If connected to a power strip or boom outlet, verify that the outlet is energized. Why this matters: Inconsistent power can allow the unit to power on but not deliver proper output under load."
    },
    {
      "title": "Confirm Output Mode and Settings",
      "instructions": "Verify correct mode (Cut, Coag, Blend). Confirm wattage setting is appropriate for the intended procedure. Ensure the unit is not in a standby or default low-power setting. Incorrect settings can mimic weak output."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the Active Electrode Pencil",
      "instructions": "Check the handpiece for damage or contamination. Ensure the electrode tip is fully seated. Replace the pencil with a known-good pencil if available. Damaged or high-resistance handpieces commonly cause weak output."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the Footswitch (If Applicable)",
      "instructions": "Verify the footswitch cable is fully seated. Test both pedals (Cut and Coag). Try activating using the hand control pencil if available. A failed footswitch or broken cable can prevent output even when the unit appears normal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the Patient Return Electrode (Grounding Pad)",
      "instructions": "Confirm proper placement and full adhesion. Check that the return electrode cable is fully inserted. Inspect for pad drying, lifting edges, or expired packaging. Try a new return electrode if unsure. Poor return contact increases impedance and may reduce or prevent output."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for REM (Return Electrode Monitoring) Alarms",
      "instructions": "Look for REM alarm indicators or error messages. Confirm the correct pad type (split vs. solid) is being used. REM detection may disable output if improper pad connection is detected."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect Output Receptacles",
      "instructions": "Ensure the active output port is secure. Check for bent pins or visible damage. Confirm the correct output port is being used. Connection issues at the generator output port can reduce energy delivery."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swap Accessories Systematically",
      "instructions": "Replace the active electrode. Replace the return electrode and cable. Replace the footswitch. Try another known-good ESU on the same accessories (if available). Systematic isolation prevents unnecessary generator removal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for Error Codes or Self-Test Failures",

      "title": "Perform a Full Power Reset",
      "instructions": "Turn the unit OFF. Disconnect the power cord from the wall outlet. Wait at least 60 seconds. Reconnect directly to a known-good wall outlet (not a power strip). Power ON and observe the startup sequence. Why this matters: Temporary logic faults or voltage instability can trigger self-test failures."

      "title": "Verify the Wall Outlet and Line Power",
      "instructions": "Confirm the outlet is hospital-grade and functioning. Test outlet with an outlet tester or plug in another known-good device. Avoid extension cords or daisy-chained power strips. Power irregularities commonly trigger startup errors."

      "title": "Disconnect All Accessories",
      "instructions": "Remove active electrode handpiece. Disconnect return electrode (REM) cable. Remove footswitch. Remove any adapters or extension cables. Power the unit ON with nothing connected. Why this matters: Faulty accessories can cause impedance or detection errors during self-test."
