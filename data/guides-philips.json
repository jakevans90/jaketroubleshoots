          {
            "title": "Check the Patient Circuit and Tubing",
            "instructions": "Ensure all connections are fully seated. Inspect for cracks, holes, or loose fittings. Verify the circuit is properly attached to the ventilator outlet. Reason: Even a small gap can cause a leak detection during self-test."

            "title": "Inspect the Exhalation Port and Filter",
            "instructions": "Confirm the exhalation port is installed correctly. Check the filter is present, seated properly, and unobstructed. Look for moisture buildup or blockages. Reason: Improper installation or obstruction can trigger a leak error."

            "title": "Check the Humidifier (If Installed)",
