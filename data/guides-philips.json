          {
            "title": "Check the Patient Circuit and Tubing",
            "instructions": "Ensure all connections are fully seated. Inspect for cracks, holes, or loose fittings. Verify the circuit is properly attached to the ventilator outlet. Reason: Even a small gap can cause a leak detection during self-test."

            "title": "Inspect the Exhalation Port and Filter",
            "instructions": "Confirm the exhalation port is installed correctly. Check the filter is present, seated properly, and unobstructed. Look for moisture buildup or blockages. Reason: Improper installation or obstruction can trigger a leak error."

            "title": "Check the Humidifier (If Installed)",
            "instructions": "Ensure the humidifier chamber is seated correctly and intact. Inspect tubing connections for tightness and leaks. Reason: Humidifier leaks are a common cause of self-test failure."

            "instructions": "If a mask is attached, ensure a proper seal. If running a self-test without a patient, verify the test plug or circuit cap is secure. Reason: Any open patient interface will cause the ventilator to detect a leak."

            "instructions": "Power the ventilator off. Re-seat the patient circuit, exhalation port, and humidifier connections. Power the ventilator back on and rerun the self-test. Reason: Resetting can clear temporary errors caused by connection issues."

The issue is likely internal (e.g., valve failure, internal leak). Next Steps: Remove the ventilator from clinical service. Clearly label it as Out of Service. Send for repair or bench evaluation.
