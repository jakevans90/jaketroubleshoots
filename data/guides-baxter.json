            "title": "Ensure Patient Safety First",
            "instructions": "If the pump is attached to an active patient, coordinate with clinical staff to transition the patient to another infusion pump before troubleshooting. Do not troubleshoot extensively while the device is actively infusing a critical medication."
          },
          {
            "title": "Inspect the IV Set and Tubing Path",
            "instructions": "Verify the tubing is correctly loaded into the pump channel. Confirm there are no kinks, sharp bends, compression points, or twisted tubing from the pump to the patient. Check that all roller clamps and slide clamps are fully open. Even minor tubing restriction can generate an occlusion alarm."
          },
          {
            "title": "Check the Patient-Side of the Line",
            "instructions": "Inspect the distal tubing and catheter site (visually only — do not manipulate invasive access unless authorized). Look for obvious downstream obstruction such as: IV pole hooks compressing tubing. Arm positioning causing line occlusion. Secondary tubing backflow issues. Occlusion alarms often originate downstream of the pump."
          },
          {
            "title": "Inspect the Cassette and Pump Door",
            "instructions": "Open the pump door and visually inspect the cassette seating. Ensure the disposable set is fully aligned and seated properly in the channel. Close the door firmly and verify it latches completely. An improperly seated cassette can cause false occlusion detection."
          },
          {
            "title": "Confirm Fluid Source and Prime Status",
            "instructions": "Verify the fluid bag contains adequate volume. Ensure the line has been properly primed and contains no large air gaps. Check that the spike is fully inserted and that the vent (if applicable) is correctly positioned."

          {
            "title": "Review Alarm Details on Display",
            "instructions": "Note the exact alarm wording (e.g., “Upstream Occlusion” vs. “Downstream Occlusion” if displayed). Observe whether the alarm triggers immediately upon start or after pressure builds. Documenting the exact alarm behavior is important for CCR documentation."
          },
          {
            "title": "Perform a Controlled Reset",
            "instructions": "Stop the infusion. Remove and reload the tubing. Close the door securely. Restart the infusion and observe pressure behavior. If the alarm clears and infusion resumes normally, monitor briefly to ensure stable operation."
          },
          {
            "title": "If the Problem Persists",
            "instructions": "If the occlusion alarm continues after completing all external checks, common causes have been ruled out. Remove the pump from clinical service. Clearly label it “Out of Service”. Send for bench evaluation or repair. Persistent occlusion alarms after tubing and cassette verification may indicate internal pressure sensor or mechanism issues. Knowing when to stop bedside troubleshooting is proper Clinical Engineering practice."
