  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a Connex 6000 monitor fails to measure blood pressure or reports an error due to a leaky hose or transducer drift.
    These steps focus on the most common and easily verified causes before assuming the module has failed internally.
  </p>
  <p>No advanced technical skills are needed — just follow the steps and observe carefully.</p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Inspect the NIBP Hose</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the hose connecting the cuff to the monitor is fully seated at both ends.</li>
    <li>Look for cracks, holes, kinks, or wear along the hose.</li>
    <li>Replace the hose if any visible damage or leaks are observed.</li>
    <li>Even a small leak can prevent proper inflation and trigger an NIBP error.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Check the Cuff and Connections</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the cuff is the correct size for the patient.</li>
    <li>Make sure the cuff tubing is fully inserted and the hook/Velcro is secure.</li>
    <li>Inspect for tears or leaks in the bladder.</li>
    <li>A poorly seated or damaged cuff can cause failed or inaccurate readings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Verify the Module / Transducer Seating</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure the NIBP module is fully inserted in the monitor.</li>
    <li>Check the connector pins for cleanliness and damage.</li>
    <li>Look for visible moisture or debris.</li>
    <li>Loose or misaligned transducers can cause drift or persistent errors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Observe the Display</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Note any error codes (e.g., “NIBP Fail,” “Low Pressure,” “Leak Detected”).</li>
    <li>Record whether the error happens immediately or intermittently.</li>
    <li>Documenting details helps CE staff identify recurring issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Try a Simple Reset</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the cuff and hose from the patient.</li>
    <li>Power cycle the monitor.</li>
    <li>Reconnect the hose and cuff, and attempt another measurement.</li>
    <li>If the measurement succeeds, the issue may have been a temporary connection or seating problem.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If the NIBP Still Fails</h3>
  <p>
    If the monitor continues to fail NIBP measurements after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you have already checked the most common and simplest causes.
  </p>

  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>inspected the hose for leaks or damage</li>
    <li>verified the cuff is correct and seated properly</li>
    <li>checked the module / transducer connections</li>
    <li>attempted a simple reset</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The issue is now likely internal (transducer drift, module malfunction, or sensor calibration problem) and cannot be resolved at the bedside.</p>
  <p>The best next step is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the monitor from clinical service</li>
    <li>clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>send it for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What the user reported.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “NIBP measurement failed; error displayed.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “Hose inspected and intact, cuff verified, module seated correctly. Measurement still fails. Suspected transducer drift or internal module fault.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed monitor from service, labeled Out of Service, sent for repair.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Tagged for bench evaluation by CE.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Hose checked / replaced</li>
    <li>Cuff verified / replaced</li>
    <li>Module reseated</li>
    <li>Error cleared / persisted</li>
    <li>Any visible damage or moisture</li>
    <li>Final disposition (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Not every NIBP failure is caused by a hose or cuff — sometimes the transducer or module develops drift or internal faults that cannot be corrected at the bedside.
    Completing these steps ensures you have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out common external causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
