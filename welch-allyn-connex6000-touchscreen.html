  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a Connex 6000 Series monitor has a touchscreen that does not respond correctly, appears misaligned, or has areas that do not register touches (dead spots).
  </p>
  <p>
    These steps focus on the most common and easily verified causes before assuming the touchscreen has failed internally.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills — just follow the steps and observe carefully.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Check for Obstructions or Contamination</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Inspect the screen for dirt, moisture, or residue.</li>
    <li>Clean the screen using an approved disinfectant wipe and allow it to dry fully.</li>
    <li>Make sure there is no plastic film, tape, or label covering the screen.</li>
    <li>Debris or moisture can interfere with touch detection and make the screen appear miscalibrated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Confirm the Monitor Is Not Frozen</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Try pressing several different areas of the screen.</li>
    <li>Observe whether any buttons respond at all.</li>
    <li>Check if the display is updating or appears stuck.</li>
    <li>A frozen screen can look like a calibration or dead-spot issue.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Power Cycle the Monitor</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn the monitor off.</li>
    <li>Wait at least 10 seconds.</li>
    <li>Power the monitor back on and allow it to fully boot.</li>
    <li>Temporary software issues can sometimes affect touchscreen response.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Check for Visible Screen Damage</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Look closely for cracks, pressure marks, or discoloration.</li>
    <li>Gently touch different areas of the screen and note where input is not detected.</li>
    <li>Physical damage can cause permanent dead zones on the touchscreen.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Observe the Behavior</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Note whether touches register in the wrong location (misalignment).</li>
    <li>Note whether certain areas do not respond at all.</li>
    <li>Record any error messages or unusual behavior.</li>
    <li>This helps determine whether the issue is calibration-related or a failed touch panel.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If the Touchscreen Issue Persists</h3>
  <p>
    If the touchscreen continues to behave incorrectly after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you have already checked the most common and simplest causes.
  </p>
  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cleaned and inspected the screen</li>
    <li>ruled out a frozen display</li>
    <li>power-cycled the monitor</li>
    <li>checked for visible damage</li>
    <li>observed the pattern of non-response</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    At this point, the issue is likely internal (touch panel failure, digitizer issue, or internal electronics) and cannot be corrected through basic bedside checks.
  </p>
  <p>The best next step is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the monitor from clinical service</li>
    <li>clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>send it for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Knowing when to stop and escalate is part of good troubleshooting.</p>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Touchscreen not responding correctly; dead spots present.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Screen cleaned and inspected, power cycled, no visible damage. Touch input still misaligned / unresponsive in certain areas. Suspected touchscreen digitizer failure.”</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed monitor from service, labeled out of service, sent for repair.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Tagged for bench evaluation by CE.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Screen cleaned</li>
    <li>Power cycled</li>
    <li>Areas of screen not responding</li>
    <li>Misalignment observed (yes / no)</li>
    <li>Visible cracks or damage</li>
    <li>Final disposition (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Not every touchscreen issue can be corrected through software or cleaning — sometimes the touch panel itself fails or drifts out of calibration.
  </p>
  <p>Completing these steps ensures you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out simple external causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
