  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>Kendall SCD 700 Series</p>

  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a Kendall SCD 700 Series unit is alarming frequently or unnecessarily.
  </p>

  <p>This may present as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Repeated “Leak” alarms</li>
    <li>Disconnection alarms when tubing appears connected</li>
    <li>Pressure fault alarms during normal use</li>
    <li>Intermittent alarms that clear and then return</li>
    <li>Alarm sounds but sleeves appear to inflate normally</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These steps focus on the most common and easily verified causes before assuming an internal sensor or control board issue.
  </p>

  <p>You do not need advanced technical skills — just follow the steps and observe carefully.</p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Identify the Exact Alarm Message</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Read the alarm message carefully.</li>
    <li>Document the exact wording.</li>
    <li>Note whether it is constant or intermittent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Precise alarm wording helps determine whether the issue is leak-related, pressure-related, or sensor-related.
  </p>

  <h4>2. Check Tubing Connections</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Disconnect and fully reseat all tubing connectors.</li>
    <li>Ensure connectors are inserted completely until firmly seated.</li>
    <li>Gently tug to confirm they are secure.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Loose connectors are the most common cause of nuisance alarms.</p>

  <h4>3. Inspect Tubing for Micro-Leaks or Kinks</h4>
  <p>Check for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hairline cracks</li>
    <li>Pinholes</li>
    <li>Soft spots</li>
    <li>Sharp bends</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Make sure tubing is not pinched under bed rails or wheels.
    Even very small leaks can trigger repeated leak or pressure alarms.
  </p>

  <h4>4. Inspect Sleeves</h4>
  <p>Check sleeves for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Torn seams</li>
    <li>Worn Velcro</li>
    <li>Poor wrap</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Ensure sleeves are wrapped snugly and evenly and confirm correct sleeve size.
    Improperly applied sleeves can cause inconsistent pressure readings.
  </p>

  <h4>5. Swap Sleeves and Tubing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Replace sleeves with a known-good set if available.</li>
    <li>Swap left and right sides to see if the alarm follows the accessory.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Observe:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the alarm follows the sleeve/tubing → accessory issue.</li>
    <li>If alarm stays on the same port → possible internal valve or sensor issue.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6. Observe Pump and Inflation Behavior</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the pump sound normal?</li>
    <li>Do sleeves inflate and deflate fully?</li>
    <li>Does the alarm trigger during inflation, hold, or deflation phase?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Consistent pump sound with normal inflation often points to minor leaks or sensor sensitivity rather than major failure.
  </p>

  <h4>7. Power Cycle the Unit</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn the unit off.</li>
    <li>Wait at least 10 seconds.</li>
    <li>Restart and begin therapy again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Temporary software or logic faults can sometimes cause repeated nuisance alarms.
  </p>

  <h4>8. Evaluate the Environment</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure tubing is not being moved excessively.</li>
    <li>Check that the unit is not positioned where tubing is constantly flexing.</li>
    <li>Verify no condensation or fluid contamination is present at connectors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Environmental movement can intermittently break the air seal.
  </p>

  <h3>If Alarms Continue After These Checks</h3>
  <p>
    If the unit continues to alarm after completing the steps above, the issue is likely internal and cannot be corrected through bedside troubleshooting.
  </p>

  <p>Possible internal causes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Internal pressure sensor drift</li>
    <li>Valve manifold issue</li>
    <li>Pump wear</li>
    <li>Control board fault</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the unit from clinical service</li>
    <li>Clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>Send for bench evaluation by Clinical Engineering</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Knowing when to escalate is part of good troubleshooting.</p>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Repeated leak alarm despite tubing appearing connected.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
  <p>
    “Tubes reseated, sleeves swapped, alarm persisted on same port. Suspected internal pressure sensor or valve issue.”
  </p>
  <p>
    or
  </p>
  <p>
    “Alarm followed sleeve when swapped. Sleeve found leaking at seam.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
  <p>
    “Replaced defective sleeve; unit returned to service.”<br>
    “Removed from service and sent for bench evaluation.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Exact alarm message</li>
    <li>Intermittent or constant</li>
    <li>Which side affected (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Sleeve swapped (yes / no)</li>
    <li>Tubing replaced (yes / no)</li>
    <li>Pump sounds normal (yes / no)</li>
    <li>Power cycled (yes / no)</li>
    <li>Final disposition</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Most nuisance alarms are caused by loose tubing, small accessory leaks, improper sleeve application, or connector seating issues.
  </p>

  <p>Completing these steps ensures you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out accessory causes</li>
    <li>✔ reduced unnecessary device swaps</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
