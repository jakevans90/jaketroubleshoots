<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Patient Monitor</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>GE Healthcare</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>CARESCAPE Canvas</p>

<h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a CARESCAPE Canvas monitor will not power on.</p>

<p>The focus is on logical, external, and easily verifiable checks before assuming internal failure. These steps rule out common power-related causes while maintaining patient safety and minimizing unnecessary escalation.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>1. Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
<p>If the monitor is in clinical use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer the patient to a functioning monitor first.</li>
<li>Do not troubleshoot while the monitor is actively required for patient care.</li>
<li>Confirm the device is safe to remove from service before proceeding.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Verify AC Power at the Outlet</h4>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the monitor is connected to a known-working hospital-grade outlet.</li>
<li>Test the outlet with a known-good device (lamp, outlet tester, etc.).</li>
<li>If plugged into a power strip, isolation transformer, or UPS, verify that device is powered on and functioning.</li>
<li>If available, try a different known-working wall outlet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Loss of upstream power is the most common and simplest cause of a “dead” monitor.</p>

<h4>3. Inspect and Reseat the Power Cord</h4>
<p>Visually inspect the power cord for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cuts or fraying</li>
<li>Bent or damaged prongs</li>
<li>Loose connector ends</li>
</ul>
<p>Reseat the cord firmly at:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wall outlet</li>
<li>The rear AC inlet of the monitor</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If available, swap with a known-good hospital-grade power cord and attempt to power on again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: A loose or internally failed cord can mimic total device failure.</p>

<h4>4. Confirm the Rear Power Switch Position</h4>
<ul>
<li>Verify the rear power rocker switch is in the ON position.</li>
<li>Then press the front power button.</li>
<li>Do not assume the switch position without physically checking it.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Observe for Any Signs of Activity</h4>
<p>When attempting to power on, closely observe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Front LED indicators</li>
<li>Brief screen flash</li>
<li>Audible fan noise</li>
<li>Clicking sounds</li>
</ul>
<p>Even minimal activity suggests partial power presence and helps narrow down whether the failure is complete or localized.</p>

<h3>If the Problem Persists</h3>
<p>If the monitor shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>No indicator lights</li>
<li>No fan noise</li>
<li>No display activity</li>
<li>No response with known-good outlet and power cord</li>
</ul>

<p>Then common external causes have been ruled out.</p>

<p>At this point, the issue is likely internal (power supply board, internal fuse, or power distribution failure).</p>

<p>The appropriate next steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the monitor from service</li>
<li>Label clearly as Out of Service</li>
<li>Send for repair or bench evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary downtime and protects patient safety. Escalation after logical checks is proper troubleshooting.</p>

<h3>Clinical Use Tip</h3>
<p>Never troubleshoot a non-powering monitor on an active patient.</p>
<p>Always:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the patient to a working monitor first</li>
<li>Confirm monitoring continuity</li>
<li>Then remove the failed unit from service</li>
</ul>
<p>Patient monitoring continuity takes priority over equipment evaluation.</p>

<h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
<p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
“Monitor will not power on.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
“Unit does not power on with known-working outlet and known-good power cord. Rear switch verified ON. No indicator lights, fan noise, or display activity observed. Suspected internal power supply failure.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Removed from service and tagged Out of Service.”</li>
<li>“Sent to Biomed shop for bench evaluation.”</li>
<li>“Dispatched for vendor repair.”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Outlet tested (yes/no)</li>
<li>Alternate outlet attempted</li>
<li>Power cord swapped (yes/no)</li>
<li>Rear switch position confirmed</li>
<li>Indicator light behavior</li>
<li>Fan noise present/absent</li>
<li>Any unusual odor or heat</li>
<li>Final device status (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thought</h3>
<p>Effective troubleshooting starts with the simplest external checks and progresses logically. Ruling out power source and connection issues protects patient safety, reduces unnecessary part replacement, and supports accurate repair escalation.</p>

<p>A Clinical Engineer’s role is not just to fix equipment — it is to think systematically, document clearly, and know when escalation is appropriate.</p>

<p>That is successful troubleshooting.</p>
