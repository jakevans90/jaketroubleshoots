  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a CARESCAPE Canvas monitor will not power on.
    These steps focus on the most common and easiest things to verify first before assuming the monitor has failed.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills to perform these checks.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Make Sure the Monitor Has Power</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the monitor is plugged into an outlet that you know is working.</li>
    <li>If unsure, plug in another device (lamp, phone charger, etc.) to test the outlet.</li>
    <li>If the monitor is plugged into a power strip or isolation transformer, make sure that device is also turned on.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Check the Power Cord</h4>
  <p>Look over the power cord for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cuts</li>
    <li>fraying</li>
    <li>bent or broken prongs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Make sure the cord is pushed in firmly at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the wall outlet</li>
    <li>the back of the monitor</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Loose connections can make the monitor appear dead even when power is available.
  </p>

  <h4>3. Confirm the Power Switch Is On</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Locate the power switch on the monitor.</li>
    <li>Make sure it is set to the ON position.</li>
    <li>Try pressing the front power button again.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Watch for Any Signs of Life</h4>
  <p>When attempting to power on, observe the monitor closely:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do any lights turn on?</li>
    <li>Does the screen flash briefly?</li>
    <li>Do you hear a fan or clicking sound?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Even small signs can help determine what is happening internally.
  </p>

  <h4>5. Try a Known-Good Power Cord (If Available)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Swap it with the current one.</li>
    <li>Try powering the monitor on again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A faulty cord can look perfectly normal from the outside.
  </p>

  <h3>If the Monitor Still Does Not Power On</h3>
  <p>
    If the monitor still will not turn on after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you have already checked the most common and simplest causes.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, the issue is likely inside the monitor (such as the internal power supply or electronics) and cannot be resolved through basic external checks.
  </p>

  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>confirmed a working outlet</li>
    <li>verified the power cord</li>
    <li>checked the power switch</li>
    <li>looked for any signs of activity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The best next step is to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the monitor from clinical service</li>
    <li>clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>send it for repair or further bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Knowing when to stop and escalate is part of good troubleshooting.
  </p>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the user.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Monitor will not power on.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “Monitor shows no power with known-working outlet and known-good power cord. No indicator lights or screen activity observed. Suspected internal power failure.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed from service and sent for repair.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Tagged out of service for further bench evaluation.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Outlet tested: yes / no</li>
    <li>Power cord swapped: yes / no</li>
    <li>Indicator light behavior</li>
    <li>Any sounds (fan, clicking, none)</li>
    <li>Any unusual smell or heat</li>
    <li>Final status (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Not every problem can be fixed at the bedside or with simple checks.
    Sometimes the correct fix is recognizing when the issue is internal and moving the device along for repair.
  </p>

  <p>Completing these steps means you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out common causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
