  <h2>Power Issue – Will Not Turn On</h2>
</section>

  <h3>Asset Type</h3>
  <p>Patient Monitor</p>

  <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
  <p>GE Healthcare</p>

  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>CARESCAPE Canvas</p>

  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a CARESCAPE Canvas monitor will not power on.</p>
  <p>The focus is on logical, external, and easily verifiable checks before assuming internal failure. These steps rule out common power-related causes while maintaining patient safety and minimizing unnecessary escalation.</p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Transfer the patient to a functioning monitor first.</li>
    <li>Do not troubleshoot while the monitor is actively required for patient care.</li>
    <li>Confirm the device is safe to remove from service before proceeding.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Verify AC Power at the Outlet</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the monitor is connected to a known-working hospital-grade outlet.</li>
    <li>Test the outlet with a known-good device (lamp, outlet tester, etc.).</li>
    <li>If plugged into a power strip, isolation transformer, or UPS, verify that device is powered on and functioning.</li>
    <li>If available, try a different known-working wall outlet.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why this matters: Loss of upstream power is the most common and simplest cause of a “dead” monitor.</p>

  <h4>3. Inspect and Reseat the Power Cord</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Visually inspect the power cord for cuts, fraying, bent or damaged prongs, and loose connector ends.</li>
    <li>Reseat the cord firmly at the wall outlet and rear AC inlet of the monitor.</li>
    <li>If available, swap with a known-good hospital-grade power cord and attempt to power on again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why this matters: A loose or internally failed cord can mimic total device failure.</p>

  <h4>4. Confirm the Rear Power Switch Position</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify the rear power rocker switch is in the ON position.</li>
    <li>Then press the front power button.</li>
    <li>Do not assume the switch position without physically checking it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Observe for Any Signs of Activity</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Watch front LED indicators, screen flash, audible fan noise, or clicking sounds.</li>
    <li>Even minimal activity suggests partial power presence and helps narrow down whether the failure is complete or localized.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If the Problem Persists</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No indicator lights</li>
    <li>No fan noise</li>
    <li>No display activity</li>
    <li>No response with known-good outlet and power cord</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Then common external causes have been ruled out. The issue is likely internal (power supply board, internal fuse, or power distribution failure).</p>
  <p>Next steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the monitor from service</li>
    <li>Label clearly as Out of Service</li>
    <li>Send for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Clinical Use Tip</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Never troubleshoot a non-powering monitor on an active patient.</li>
    <li>Move the patient to a working monitor first.</li>
    <li>Confirm monitoring continuity, then remove the failed unit from service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>Example: “Monitor will not power on.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>Example: “Unit does not power on with known-working outlet and known-good power cord. Rear switch verified ON. No indicator lights, fan noise, or display activity observed. Suspected internal power supply failure.”</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Removed from service and tagged Out of Service.</li>
    <li>Sent to Biomed shop for bench evaluation.</li>
    <li>Dispatched for vendor repair.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Outlet tested (yes/no)</li>
    <li>Alternate outlet attempted</li>
    <li>Power cord swapped (yes/no)</li>
    <li>Rear switch position confirmed</li>
    <li>Indicator light behavior</li>
    <li>Fan noise present/absent</li>
    <li>Any unusual odor or heat</li>
    <li>Final device status (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>Effective troubleshooting starts with the simplest external checks and progresses logically. Ruling out power source and connection issues protects patient safety, reduces unnecessary part replacement, and supports accurate repair escalation.</p>
  <p>A Clinical Engineer’s role is not just to fix equipment — it is to think systematically, document clearly, and know when escalation is appropriate.</p>
