  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a SIGMA Spectrum infusion pump will not start an infusion due to an occlusion alarm.
    These steps focus on the most common and easiest things to verify before assuming the pump has failed.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills to perform these checks — just follow the steps and observe carefully.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Check the IV Set and Tubing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure the tubing is properly loaded into the pump.</li>
    <li>Confirm there are no kinks, twists, or sharp bends in the line.</li>
    <li>Check that clamps are fully open and not blocking fluid flow.</li>
    <li>Even a small pinch or bend can trigger an occlusion alarm.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Inspect the Pump Door and Cassette</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the cassette or disposable set is seated correctly.</li>
    <li>Close the door fully — the pump may not start if it senses the door is ajar.</li>
    <li>Some alarms are triggered if the cassette isn’t aligned properly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Check the Fluid Bag or Syringe</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure there is fluid in the bag or syringe.</li>
    <li>Confirm that the tubing is primed — air in the line can sometimes trigger an occlusion alarm.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Observe the Pump Display and Alarm</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Look for any other messages on the display.</li>
    <li>Note the type of alarm shown (for example: occlusion, warning, or low fluid).</li>
    <li>Record what you see — this helps when documenting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Try a Simple Reset</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Stop the pump.</li>
    <li>Remove and reload the tubing.</li>
    <li>Close the door and restart the pump.</li>
    <li>If the alarm clears, the pump may resume infusion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If the Alarm Still Persists</h3>
  <p>
    If the pump continues to display an occlusion alarm after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you have already checked the most common and simplest causes.
  </p>

  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>confirmed tubing is properly loaded and free of kinks</li>
    <li>verified the door and cassette are seated correctly</li>
    <li>checked that fluid is present and tubing is primed</li>
    <li>attempted a simple reset</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The best next step is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the pump from clinical service</li>
    <li>clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>send it for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What the user reported.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Pump will not start infusion; occlusion alarm displayed.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “Tubing and cassette inspected, tubing free of kinks, door fully closed, fluid present. Alarm persists. Suspected internal pump sensor issue.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed pump from service, labeled out of service, sent for repair.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Tagged for bench evaluation by CE.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tubing checked / replaced</li>
    <li>Door/cassette reseated</li>
    <li>Fluid bag checked / primed</li>
    <li>Alarm cleared / persisted</li>
    <li>Any unusual sounds or display behavior</li>
    <li>Final disposition (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Not every occlusion alarm is caused by a blocked line — sometimes the pump’s internal sensors detect a problem that cannot be corrected at the bedside.
  </p>

  <p>Completing these steps means you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out common causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
