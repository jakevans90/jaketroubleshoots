  <h2>About & Contact</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to Jake Troubleshoots — a growing collection of real-world clinical engineering troubleshooting guides.
  </p>

  <h3>Who I Am</h3>
  <p>
    Hey, I’m Jake. I’ve been troubleshooting electronics for about 15 years, and for most of that time I’ve worked as a biomedical equipment technician in clinical environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve spent my career fixing everything from simple devices to complex systems, usually under time pressure and with patient care on the line.
  </p>

  <h3>Why This Site Exists</h3>
  <p>
    Over the years, I noticed something that kept repeating itself: when equipment fails in a clinical setting, stress goes up fast — and logical troubleshooting often goes out the window.
  </p>
  <p>
    Service manuals are great at explaining how to replace parts, but they rarely teach how to <strong>think</strong> through a failure. They also don’t always match the real-world problems we see in hospitals.
  </p>
  <p>
    I created this site to bridge that gap. These guides aren’t just about fixing equipment — they’re about building a troubleshooting mindset that works under pressure.
  </p>

  <h3>What Makes These Guides Different</h3>
  <p>
    Instead of only listing repair steps, these guides focus on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Logical troubleshooting paths</li>
    <li>Common failure patterns seen in real clinical use</li>
    <li>Simple checks before expensive parts are replaced</li>
    <li>Clear symptom-based diagnosis</li>
    <li>What usually causes wasted time and misdiagnosis</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The goal is not just to fix today’s problem, but to make the next problem easier to solve.
  </p>

  <h3>Troubleshooting & Documentation</h3>
  <p>
    In clinical engineering, troubleshooting and documentation go hand in hand. A repair isn’t finished until someone else can understand what failed, what was checked, and what corrected the issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    These guides also aim to model good documentation habits — not just “replaced part,” but meaningful notes that explain symptoms, causes, and outcomes.
  </p>

  <h3>Who This Site Is For</h3>
  <p>
    This site is built for clinical engineers and biomedical technicians who:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Want clearer, real-world troubleshooting guidance</li>
    <li>Feel overwhelmed when equipment fails under pressure</li>
    <li>Learn better from logic and examples than dense manuals</li>
    <li>Want to improve both troubleshooting and documentation skills</li>
  </ul>
