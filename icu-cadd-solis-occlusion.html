  <p>Infusion Pump</p>

  <h3>Manufacturer</h3>

  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>CADD-Solis</p>

  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a CADD-Solis pump triggers occlusion alarms,
    including alarms during infusion, at unexpected times, or frequent false alarms.
  </p>
  <p>
    These steps focus on the most common and easily verified causes before assuming tubing failure,
    pump occlusion sensor failure, or internal pressure sensor malfunction.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills — just follow the steps carefully and observe what happens.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Check Tubing Path for Obstructions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Stop the pump if running.</li>
    <li>Inspect the entire infusion set from the cassette to the patient.</li>
    <li>Ensure tubing is free of kinks or sharp bends, not pinched under clamps or clothing, and correctly seated in the cassette pressure channel.</li>
    <li>Even minor kinks can trigger false occlusion alarms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Inspect the Cassette Pressure Plate and Tubing Channel</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the cassette.</li>
    <li>Look for debris or dried medication in the tubing channel, warped or cracked pressure plate, improperly seated tubing.</li>
    <li>Clean per facility policy. Misalignment or debris can cause the pump to detect pressure incorrectly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Confirm Correct Cassette and Tubing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure tubing type matches therapy type (continuous, PCA, or intermittent).</li>
    <li>Verify tubing is compatible with CADD-Solis cassettes.</li>
    <li>Confirm tubing is not expired or damaged.</li>
    <li>Incorrect or worn tubing can trigger intermittent occlusion alarms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Check Pump Orientation and Placement</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Position pump per manufacturer guidelines (usually upright or at specified angle).</li>
    <li>Ensure tubing runs freely to the patient without sharp bends or tension.</li>
    <li>Avoid hanging the pump upside-down or placing tubing under tension.</li>
    <li>Pressure sensors can falsely trigger if pump orientation is incorrect.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Power Cycle the Pump</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn the pump off.</li>
    <li>Wait at least 10 seconds.</li>
    <li>Turn it back on.</li>
    <li>Reinstall cassette and tubing.</li>
    <li>Temporary sensor glitches can clear after a reboot.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6. Test with a Known-Good Cassette and Tubing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Replace cassette and tubing with new or verified working components.</li>
    <li>Attempt infusion at same settings.</li>
    <li>If false alarms stop: original cassette or tubing is likely defective.</li>
    <li>If alarms continue: internal occlusion/pressure sensor issue or pump logic error is likely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>7. Observe Alarm Patterns</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Document if alarm occurs immediately upon starting infusion or at specific rates/pressures.</li>
    <li>Check for fluid in tubing or cassette causing air bubbles.</li>
    <li>See if alarm clears when tubing is gently adjusted or re-seated.</li>
    <li>Pattern observation helps determine whether cause is external or internal.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If Occlusion Alarms Persist</h3>
  <p>
    If alarms continue after completing the steps above:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inspect tubing and cassette</li>
    <li>Confirm proper placement and orientation</li>
    <li>Power-cycle the pump</li>
    <li>Test with known-good components</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Likely causes at this point include internal pressure sensor failure, pressure plate detection issues, or pump logic/firmware problems.
    These cannot be corrected through bedside troubleshooting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next steps:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the pump from clinical service</li>
    <li>Label as Out of Service</li>
    <li>Send for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Pump repeatedly alarms for occlusion; tubing appears patent.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Tubing inspected and re-seated, cassette replaced, pump power-cycled. False occlusion persists. Suspected internal pressure sensor or pressure plate failure.”</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed pump from service, labeled out of service, sent for repair.”<br>
    “Tagged for CE bench evaluation.”<br>
    “Replaced defective tubing/cassette; infusion resumed without alarms.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tubing path clear (yes / no)</li>
    <li>Tubing tested (yes / no)</li>
    <li>Cassette replaced/tested</li>
    <li>Pump orientation correct</li>
    <li>Alarm occurs immediately or during infusion</li>
    <li>Final disposition (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Most false occlusion alarms are caused by kinks or tension in tubing, tubing misalignment in cassette, or debris/warping of pressure plate.
    Internal sensor failures are less common but can occur, particularly with high-use pumps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Completing these steps ensures you have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out simple external causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient therapy continuity</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
