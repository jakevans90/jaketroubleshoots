  <h3>Asset Type</h3>
  <p>Defibrillator</p>

  <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
  <p>ZOLL</p>

  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>R Series</p>

  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a ZOLL R Series defibrillator’s printer will not print or reports a paper jam.
    The R Series printer uses thermal paper, so some issues may relate to paper quality or handling.
    These steps focus on the most common and easiest things to verify first before assuming the printer or device has failed.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills to perform these checks.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Check the Paper Stack</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure there is a paper stack loaded in the printer’s tray.</li>
    <li>Confirm the leading edge of the top sheet is correctly positioned in the feed mechanism.</li>
    <li>Replace the stack if it is empty, wrinkled, or damaged.</li>
    <li><em>Note:</em> Thermal paper is sensitive to heat, pressure, and folds. Crumpled or old paper may not feed properly or print.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Inspect for Paper Jams</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the printer cover and remove any misfed or stuck sheets.</li>
    <li>Look for small bits of torn paper or debris blocking the feed path.</li>
    <li>Ensure the feed path is clear before closing the cover.</li>
    <li>Thermal paper jams can occur if the stack is compressed too tightly or the edges are bent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Verify Printer Cover is Closed Properly</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The printer will not operate if the cover is not fully closed.</li>
    <li>Close the printer cover until it clicks into place.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Try a Known-Good Thermal Paper Stack (If Available)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If the printer still fails to print, replace the current stack with a new, known-good thermal paper stack.</li>
    <li>Attempt a test print or generate a report from the device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Observe the Device Display</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Note exactly what the display or status indicator shows: “Paper Jam”, “Printer Error”, or “Insert Paper”.</li>
    <li>Record the message for documentation and trend tracking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If the Printer Still Does Not Work</h3>
  <p>
    If the printer still will not print after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you’ve already addressed the most common causes.
  </p>

  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>confirmed paper is loaded correctly and in good condition</li>
    <li>cleared any jams</li>
    <li>closed the printer cover properly</li>
    <li>tried a known-good paper stack</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The best next step is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the printer from clinical use if necessary</li>
    <li>label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>escalate for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the user.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Printer will not print / paper jam.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “Paper stack loaded and properly seated, but printer still displays jam error. Paper cleared and cover closed. Suspected printer mechanism or thermal feed issue.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Replaced thermal paper stack and cleared feed path; printer now functional.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Tagged printer out of service and sent for repair.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Paper stack loaded correctly and in good condition: yes / no</li>
    <li>Jam cleared: yes / no</li>
    <li>Printer cover closed: yes / no</li>
    <li>Test print performed: yes / no</li>
    <li>Display message</li>
    <li>Final status (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Thermal printers are sensitive to paper handling, heat, and folds. Properly loaded, undamaged thermal paper prevents most printing issues.
  </p>

  <p>Completing these steps means you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out common issues</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
