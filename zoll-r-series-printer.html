  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a ZOLL R Series defibrillator’s printer will not print or reports a paper jam.
    These steps focus on the most common and easiest things to verify first before assuming the printer or device has failed.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills to perform these checks.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Check the Paper Roll</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure there is a paper roll installed in the printer.</li>
    <li>Confirm that the paper is inserted correctly with the leading edge feeding into the printer mechanism.</li>
    <li>Replace the roll if it is missing or empty.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Inspect for Paper Jams</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the printer cover and remove any crumpled or stuck paper.</li>
    <li>Check for small bits of torn paper that could block the printer path.</li>
    <li>Make sure the paper path is clear before closing the cover.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Verify Printer Door is Closed Properly</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The printer will not operate if the cover or door is not fully closed.</li>
    <li>Close the printer door until it clicks into place.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Try a Known-Good Paper Roll (If Available)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If the printer still fails to print, replace the paper roll with a known-good roll.</li>
    <li>Attempt a test print or generate a report from the device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Observe the Device Display</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Note any error messages, such as: “Paper Jam”, “Printer Error”, or “Replace Paper”.</li>
    <li>Record the message for documentation and trend tracking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If the Printer Still Does Not Work</h3>
  <p>
    If the printer still will not print after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you’ve already addressed the most common causes.
  </p>

  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>confirmed paper is installed correctly</li>
    <li>cleared any jams</li>
    <li>closed the printer cover properly</li>
    <li>tried a known-good paper roll</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The best next step is to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the printer from clinical use if necessary</li>
    <li>label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>escalate for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Recognizing when to escalate prevents further damage and ensures documentation is accurate.
  </p>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the user.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Printer will not print / paper jam.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “Paper roll installed, but printer still displays jam error. Paper path cleared and cover closed. Suspected printer mechanism failure.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Replaced paper roll and cleared jam; printer now functional.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Tagged printer out of service and sent for repair.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Paper roll installed: yes / no</li>
    <li>Jam cleared: yes / no</li>
    <li>Printer cover closed: yes / no</li>
    <li>Test print performed: yes / no</li>
    <li>Display message</li>
    <li>Final status (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Printer errors often stem from paper jams or misfeeds. Addressing the simplest causes first protects the device and ensures accurate reporting.
  </p>

  <p>Completing these steps means you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out common issues</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
