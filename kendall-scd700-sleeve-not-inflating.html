  <h3>Asset Type</h3>
  <p>Sequential Compression Device (SCD)</p>

  <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
  <p>Cardinal Health</p>

  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>Kendall SCD 700 Series</p>

  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when one or more sleeves connected to a Kendall SCD 700 Series unit are not inflating properly.
  </p>

  <p>This may present as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One leg inflates but the other does not</li>
    <li>Both sleeves connected but neither inflates</li>
    <li>Partial inflation or weak compression</li>
    <li>Machine running but no pressure delivered</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These steps focus on the most common and easily verified causes before assuming an internal pump or valve failure.
  </p>

  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills — just follow the steps and observe carefully.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Confirm the Unit Is Powered and Running</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the device is powered on.</li>
    <li>Confirm there are no active alarms.</li>
    <li>Verify the therapy mode is started (not just powered on).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The unit may be powered but therapy not initiated.</p>

  <h4>2. Check Sleeve and Tubing Connections</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm tubing is fully seated into the correct port.</li>
    <li>Listen/feel for a “click” when inserting connectors.</li>
    <li>Inspect for partially disconnected tubing.</li>
    <li>Swap ports (left/right) to see if the issue follows the sleeve or stays with the port.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Loose or partially seated connectors are the most common cause of one sleeve not inflating.</p>

  <h4>3. Inspect the Tubing for Kinks or Damage</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Check the entire length of tubing for sharp bends.</li>
    <li>Ensure tubing is not pinched under bed rails or wheels.</li>
    <li>Look for cracks, tears, or punctures.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even a small leak can prevent proper inflation.</p>

  <h4>4. Inspect the Sleeves Themselves</h4>
  <p>Look for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visible tears</li>
    <li>Separated seams</li>
    <li>Worn Velcro preventing proper wrap</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Ensure sleeves are wrapped snugly but not overly tight.
    A sleeve that cannot seal properly may not hold pressure.
  </p>

  <h4>5. Swap Sleeves</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Disconnect both sleeves.</li>
    <li>Swap the left sleeve to the right port and vice versa.</li>
    <li>Observe whether the issue follows the sleeve or stays with the port.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If the problem follows the sleeve → sleeve is likely defective.<br>
    If the problem stays on the same port → internal valve or channel issue suspected.
  </p>

  <h4>6. Check for Alarm Messages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Leak detected</li>
    <li>Disconnected tubing</li>
    <li>Pressure fault</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Record any alarms exactly as shown.</p>

  <h4>7. Listen for Pump Activity</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>When therapy starts, you should hear the internal pump cycling.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If the pump runs but no inflation occurs → possible internal valve leak or manifold issue.<br>
    If no pump sound at all → possible internal motor or board issue.
  </p>

  <h3>If the Sleeve Still Does Not Inflate</h3>
  <p>
    If the issue persists after completing the steps above, you have already:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Verified the unit is powered and therapy started</li>
    <li>Checked tubing connections</li>
    <li>Inspected for kinks and leaks</li>
    <li>Examined sleeves for damage</li>
    <li>Swapped sleeves to isolate the problem</li>
    <li>Checked for alarms</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The issue is likely internal and may involve:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Internal valve failure</li>
    <li>Pump motor issue</li>
    <li>Pressure sensor malfunction</li>
    <li>Internal manifold leak</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These cannot be corrected through bedside checks.</p>

  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the unit from clinical service</li>
    <li>Clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>Send for repair or bench evaluation by Clinical Engineering</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Knowing when to escalate is part of good troubleshooting.</p>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “One sleeve not inflating; right leg no compression.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Tubing and sleeve inspected, swapped ports, issue remained on right port. Suspected internal valve failure.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Swapped sleeves and problem followed sleeve. Sleeve found leaking.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Replaced defective sleeve; unit returned to service.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Removed device from service; sent for bench evaluation.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Which side affected (left/right)</li>
    <li>Alarm messages present (yes/no + exact wording)</li>
    <li>Sleeve swapped (yes/no)</li>
    <li>Issue followed sleeve or stayed with port</li>
    <li>Tubing condition</li>
    <li>Pump audible (yes/no)</li>
    <li>Final disposition</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Most sleeve inflation problems are caused by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ loose tubing connections</li>
    <li>✔ kinked lines</li>
    <li>✔ damaged sleeves</li>
    <li>✔ improperly wrapped cuffs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Completing these steps ensures you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out accessory failure</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary device swaps</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
