  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a ZOLL R Series defibrillator reports that the therapy pads are not detected, often due to a therapy cable failure.
    These steps focus on the most common and easiest things to verify first before assuming the cable or device has failed.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills to perform these checks.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Check That the Pads Are Connected Properly</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure both therapy pads are securely attached to the therapy cable.</li>
    <li>Confirm the pads are fully inserted into the connector port on the defibrillator.</li>
    <li>Loose connections can prevent the device from recognizing the pads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Inspect the Pads and Cable for Damage</h4>
  <p>Look for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cracked or torn pads</li>
    <li>Exposed wires</li>
    <li>Frayed or twisted cable</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Replace pads or cable if any visible damage is present. Even small damage can cause the device to detect a failure.</p>

  <h4>3. Try a Known-Good Pad Set or Cable (If Available)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the current pads or therapy cable and connect a known-good set.</li>
    <li>Observe if the defibrillator recognizes them correctly.</li>
    <li>This helps determine whether the issue is with the cable, pads, or device itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Observe the Device Display</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Note exactly what the display or status indicator shows: “Pads Not Detected” or “Therapy Cable Failure”.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to whether the message appears immediately or intermittently.</li>
    <li>Even small details help identify intermittent cable or connector issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Check Pad Expiration</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify that the pads are within their expiration date.</li>
    <li>Expired pads may not properly connect or be recognized by the device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If the Pads Still Are Not Detected</h3>
  <p>
    If the defibrillator still reports pads are not detected after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you’ve already addressed the most common and simplest causes.
  </p>

  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ensured the pads are connected properly</li>
    <li>inspected for visible damage</li>
    <li>tested with a known-good pad set or cable</li>
    <li>checked pad expiration</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The best next step is to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the defective pads/cable from clinical use</li>
    <li>label them as Out of Service</li>
    <li>replace with a known-good set or send for evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Knowing when to escalate is part of safe and effective troubleshooting.
  </p>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the user.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Defibrillator reports pads not detected / therapy cable failure.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “Pads and cable inspected, no visible damage. Tested with known-good pads/cable: issue resolved. Suspected faulty therapy cable.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed faulty cable/pads from service and replaced with known-good set.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Tagged pads/cable out of service and sent for evaluation.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pads/cable reseated: yes / no</li>
    <li>Pads/cable inspected for damage: yes / no</li>
    <li>Alternate pads/cable tested: yes / no</li>
    <li>Device display message</li>
    <li>Expiration date of pads</li>
    <li>Final status (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Pads and therapy cables are consumable and subject to wear. A “pads not detected” alarm prevents the device from delivering therapy with a potentially unreliable connection.
  </p>

  <p>Completing these steps means you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out simple connection or cable issues</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
