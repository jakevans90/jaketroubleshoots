  <p>Battery Issue – Fails Self-Test</p>
</section>

<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">

  <h3>Asset Type</h3>
  <p>Defibrillator</p>

  <h3>Manufacturer</h3>
  <p>ZOLL</p>

  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>R Series</p>

  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a ZOLL R Series defibrillator reports that the battery has failed its self-test.
    These steps focus on the most common and easiest things to verify first before assuming the battery or device has failed.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills to perform these checks.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Make Sure the Battery Is Fully Seated</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the battery is installed correctly in the defibrillator.</li>
    <li>Remove the battery and reinsert it, making sure it seats firmly into place.</li>
    <li>A loose battery can cause a self-test failure even if the battery itself is good.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Check the Battery Contacts</h4>
  <p>Inspect the battery and device contacts for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>dirt or debris</li>
    <li>corrosion</li>
    <li>bent or damaged pins</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If safe to do so:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>gently clean visible debris</li>
    <li>reinsert the battery</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Poor contact between the battery and the device can cause charging and self-test issues.
  </p>

  <h4>3. Verify the Battery Has Been Charging</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the defibrillator is normally stored plugged into AC power.</li>
    <li>Check for any charging or status indicators.</li>
    <li>A battery that has not been charging may fail self-test due to low capacity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Try a Known-Good Battery (If Available)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the current battery.</li>
    <li>Install a known-good battery from another unit.</li>
    <li>Allow the unit to complete its self-test again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This helps determine whether the problem is the battery or the defibrillator.
  </p>

  <h4>5. Observe the Self-Test Message</h4>
  <p>Note exactly what the device reports:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Battery Fail”</li>
    <li>“Replace Battery”</li>
    <li>Failure after charging vs immediate failure</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Even small wording differences can help narrow down the cause.
  </p>

  <h3>If the Battery Still Fails Self-Test</h3>
  <p>
    If the battery continues to fail the self-test after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you have already checked the most common and simplest causes.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, the issue is likely internal to the battery pack and cannot be corrected through basic external checks.
  </p>

  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>confirmed the battery is seated properly</li>
    <li>checked the contacts</li>
    <li>verified charging</li>
    <li>tested with another battery (if available)</li>
    <li>observed the self-test message</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The best next step is to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the battery from clinical service</li>
    <li>clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>replace it with a known-good battery or send it for evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Knowing when to stop and remove a failed battery is part of good troubleshooting and patient safety.
  </p>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the user.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Defibrillator reports battery failed self-test.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “Battery fails self-test after reseating and charging. Alternate battery passes self-test. Suspected failed battery pack.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed battery from service and replaced with known-good battery.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Tagged battery out of service and sent for evaluation.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Battery reseated: yes / no</li>
    <li>Contacts inspected: yes / no</li>
    <li>Alternate battery tested: yes / no</li>
    <li>Self-test message displayed</li>
    <li>Any unusual heat or swelling</li>
    <li>Final status (battery replaced or sent for evaluation)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Batteries are consumable parts and will eventually fail over time.
    A failed self-test is the device’s way of preventing unreliable operation during an emergency.
  </p>

  <p>Completing these steps means you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out simple causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
