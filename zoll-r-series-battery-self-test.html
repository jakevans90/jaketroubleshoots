  <p>Battery Issue – Fails Self-Test</p>
</section>

<main style="max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto; padding: 0 20px;">

<h3>Asset Type</h3>
<p>Defibrillator</p>

<h3>Manufacturer</h3>
<p>ZOLL</p>

<h3>Model</h3>
<p>R Series</p>

<h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
<p>This guide provides a structured Clinical Engineering approach when a ZOLL R Series defibrillator reports that the battery has failed its self-test.</p>

<p>The focus is on simple, external, and easily verifiable causes before assuming battery pack failure. These steps prioritize patient safety and proper escalation without unnecessary disassembly or advanced repair.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>Ensure the Device Is Not in Active Clinical Use</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Before troubleshooting, confirm the defibrillator is not connected to a patient. If the device is needed for patient care, replace it with a known-good unit first.</li>
  <li>Self-test and battery troubleshooting should never be performed on an active emergency device.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify the Battery Is Fully Seated</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the battery from the rear compartment.</li>
  <li>Inspect the latch mechanism and rails. Reinstall the battery firmly until it locks into place.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why this matters:
A partially seated battery can interrupt power continuity and trigger a self-test failure even if the battery is functional.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Power the unit on and allow the self-test to complete.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspect Battery and Device Contacts</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Visually inspect:</li>
  <li>Battery terminals</li>
  <li>Device-side contact pins</li>
  <li>Signs of debris, corrosion, or bent contacts</li>
  <li>If debris is present, gently clean using an approved method.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why this matters:
Poor electrical contact can cause charging faults or self-test failure messages.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Reinstall the battery and repeat the self-test.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Verify Charging Status</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the defibrillator is stored connected to AC power per department policy.</li>
  <li>Check for:</li>
  <li>Charging indicator lights</li>
  <li>Docking station power (if applicable)</li>
  <li>AC outlet functionality</li>
  <li>If possible, allow the battery to charge for a sufficient period and reattempt the self-test.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why this matters:
Low capacity or deep discharge can cause a battery to fail self-test.</em></p>

<h4>Test With a Known-Good Battery (If Available)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the suspect battery.</li>
  <li>Install a known-good battery from another ZOLL R Series unit.</li>
  <li>Allow the unit to complete its self-test.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If the alternate battery passes → Likely failed battery pack</li>
  <li>If the alternate battery also fails → Possible device-side issue</li>
</ul>

<p>This step isolates whether the issue follows the battery or remains with the device.</p>

<h4>Document the Exact Self-Test Message</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Record the exact wording displayed:</li>
  <li>“Battery Fail”</li>
  <li>“Replace Battery”</li>
  <li>Immediate failure vs failure after charge cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Small differences in wording may indicate capacity failure versus communication error.</p>

<h4>If the Problem Persists</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If the battery continues to fail self-test after:</li>
  <li>Reseating</li>
  <li>Contact inspection</li>
  <li>Charging verification</li>
  <li>Known-good battery testing</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is likely internal to the battery pack or, if failures persist with multiple batteries, internal to the defibrillator power management system.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At this point:</li>
  <li>Remove the affected battery (or device if necessary) from service</li>
  <li>Clearly label it Out of Service</li>
  <li>Send for evaluation or replacement per department protocol</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing when to stop is proper troubleshooting. Continuing beyond external checks risks unsafe equipment returning to service.</p>

<h3>Clinical Use Tip</h3>
<p>A defibrillator battery that fails self-test should never remain on an emergency crash cart.</p>

<p>Always replace the battery or the entire device before returning it to a clinical area. A failed battery may power on initially but may not sustain therapy delivery during an actual code.</p>

<p>Patient safety comes first.</p>

<h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
<p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

<h4>Complaint</h4>
<p>What was reported.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Unit reports battery failed self-test during daily check.”</p>

<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>What was determined during troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>“Battery fails self-test after reseating and charging. Known-good battery passes. Suspected failed battery pack.”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“Multiple batteries fail in same unit. Suspected internal device power issue.”</p>

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<p>What action was taken.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>“Removed battery from service and replaced with known-good battery.”</p>
<p>“Tagged battery Out of Service and sent for evaluation.”</p>
<p>“Removed device from service pending bench evaluation.”</p>

<h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Battery reseated: yes / no</li>
  <li>Contacts inspected: yes / no</li>
  <li>AC outlet verified: yes / no</li>
  <li>Alternate battery tested: yes / no</li>
  <li>Exact self-test message</li>
  <li>Any unusual heat, swelling, or odor</li>
  <li>Final device status (returned to service or removed)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thought</h3>
<p>Defibrillator batteries are consumable components and will eventually fail. The self-test system is designed to prevent unreliable operation during a life-saving event.</p>

<p>By following a logical, step-by-step approach, you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rule out simple external causes</li>
  <li>Protect patient safety</li>
  <li>Avoid unnecessary internal repair</li>
  <li>Provide clear documentation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
