  <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a ZOLL R Series defibrillator reports that the battery has failed its self-test.
    These steps focus on the most common and easiest things to verify first before assuming the battery or device has failed.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills to perform these checks.

  <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h3>Make Sure the Battery Is Fully Seated</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the battery is installed correctly in the defibrillator.</li>
    <li>Remove the battery and reinsert it, making sure it clicks or seats firmly into place.</li>
    <li>A loose battery can cause self-test failures even if the battery itself is good.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Check the Battery Contacts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Inspect the battery and device contacts for:
      <ul>
        <li>dirt or debris</li>
        <li>corrosion</li>
        <li>bent or damaged pins</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If safe to do so, gently clean visible debris from the contacts and reinsert the battery.</li>
    <li>Poor contact between the battery and device can cause charging and self-test issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Verify the Battery Has Been Charging</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the defibrillator has been plugged into AC power when stored.</li>
    <li>Check for any charging or status indicators that show the battery has been receiving power.</li>
    <li>A battery that has not been charging may fail self-test due to low capacity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Try a Known-Good Battery (If Available)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the current battery and insert a known-good battery from another unit.</li>
    <li>Allow the unit to complete its self-test again.</li>
    <li>This helps determine whether the issue is with the battery or the defibrillator itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Observe the Self-Test Message or Indicator</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Note exactly what the display or status indicator shows:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Does it say “Battery Fail”?</li>
      <li>Does it say “Replace Battery”?</li>
      <li>Does it fail immediately or after charging?</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Even small details can help determine the cause.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="section">
  <h2>If the Battery Still Fails Self-Test</h2>
  <p>
    If the battery continues to fail the self-test after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you have already checked the most common and simplest causes.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, the issue is likely related to the battery’s internal cells or electronics and cannot be resolved through basic external checks.
  </p>

  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>confirmed the battery is seated properly</li>
    <li>checked the contacts</li>
    <li>verified charging</li>
    <li>tested with another battery (if available)</li>
    <li>observed the self-test message</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The best next step is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the battery from clinical use</li>
    <li>clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>replace it with a known-good battery or send it for evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Knowing when to remove a battery from service is part of good troubleshooting and patient safety.

  <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <div class="ccr">
    <h3>Complaint</h3>
    <p>What was reported by the user.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Defibrillator reports battery failed self-test.”</p>

    <h3>Cause</h3>
    <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Battery fails self-test after reseating and charging. Alternate battery passes self-test. Suspected failed battery pack.”</p>

    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <p>What action was taken.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Removed battery from service and replaced with known-good battery.”</li>
      <li>“Tagged battery out of service and sent for evaluation.”</li>
    </ul>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Battery reseated: yes / no</li>
    <li>Contacts inspected: yes / no</li>
    <li>Alternate battery tested: yes / no</li>
    <li>Self-test message displayed</li>
    <li>Any unusual heat or swelling</li>
    <li>Final status (battery replaced or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>
    Batteries are consumable parts and will eventually fail over time. A failed self-test is the device’s way of preventing unreliable operation during an emergency.
  </p>
  <p>Completing these steps means you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out simple connection and charging issues</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
