  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a GE B850 monitor will not power on.
    These steps focus on the most common and easiest things to verify first before assuming the monitor has failed.
  </p>
  <p>You do not need advanced technical skills to perform these checks.</p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Make Sure the Monitor Has Power</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the monitor is plugged into an outlet that you know is working.</li>
    <li>If unsure, plug in another device (lamp, phone charger, etc.) to test the outlet.</li>
    <li>If the monitor is plugged into a power strip or isolation transformer, make sure that device is also turned on.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Check the Power Cord</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Look over the power cord for cuts, fraying, or bent/broken prongs.</li>
    <li>Make sure the cord is pushed in firmly at both the wall outlet and the back of the monitor.</li>
    <li>Loose connections can make the monitor appear dead even when power is available.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Confirm the Power Switch Is On</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Locate the power switch on the monitor.</li>
    <li>Make sure it is set to the ON position.</li>
    <li>Try pressing the front power button again.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Watch for Any Signs of Life</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>When attempting to power on, observe the monitor closely.</li>
    <li>Do any lights turn on? Does the screen flash briefly? Do you hear a fan or clicking sound?</li>
    <li>Even small signs can help determine what is happening internally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Try a Known-Good Power Cord (If Available)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Swap it with the current one.</li>
    <li>Try powering the monitor on again.</li>
    <li>A faulty cord can look perfectly normal from the outside.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If the Monitor Still Does Not Power On</h3>
  <p>
    If the monitor still will not turn on after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you have already checked the most common and simplest causes.
  </p>

  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>confirmed a working outlet</li>
    <li>verified the power cord</li>
    <li>checked the power switch</li>
    <li>looked for any signs of activity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The issue is now likely internal (such as the power supply or electronics) and cannot be resolved at the bedside.</p>
  <p>The best next step is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the monitor from clinical service</li>
    <li>clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>send it for repair or further bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What the user reported.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Monitor will not power on.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “Monitor shows no power with known-working outlet and known-good power cord. No indicator lights or screen activity observed. Suspected internal power failure.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed from service and sent for repair.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Tagged out of service for further bench evaluation.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Outlet tested: yes / no</li>
    <li>Power cord swapped: yes / no</li>
    <li>Indicator light behavior</li>
    <li>Any sounds (fan, clicking, none)</li>
    <li>Any unusual smell or heat</li>
    <li>Final status (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Not every power issue can be fixed at the bedside — sometimes the problem is internal and requires repair.
    Completing these steps ensures you have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out common causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
