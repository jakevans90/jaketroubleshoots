  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a Kendall SCD 700 Series unit does not power on. 
    These steps focus on the most common and easily verified causes before assuming an internal failure.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need advanced technical skills — just follow the steps and observe carefully.
  </p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Confirm Power Source</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the unit is plugged into a live AC outlet.</li>
    <li>Test the outlet with another device to confirm power availability.</li>
    <li>If using the battery option (if applicable), verify batteries are installed correctly and fully charged.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A disconnected, depleted, or incorrect power source is the most common reason the unit won’t power on.
  </p>

  <h4>2. Check the Power Switch</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the power switch is fully in the “ON” position.</li>
    <li>Listen or look for any indicator lights.</li>
    <li>Sometimes the switch may feel “on” but have poor internal contact.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Inspect the Power Cord and Connectors</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Examine the cord for frays, cuts, or exposed wires.</li>
    <li>Confirm all connectors are clean, free from debris, and fully seated.</li>
    <li>Replace any damaged cord immediately — do not operate with exposed wires.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Test With a Known-Good Outlet or Battery</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Plug the unit into a different, verified outlet.</li>
    <li>If battery-operated, swap with a fully charged battery pack if available.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This eliminates the power source as the cause.</p>

  <h4>5. Observe Indicator Lights or Sounds</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Kendall SCD 700 units often have LED indicators or audible beeps.</li>
    <li>No lights may indicate a blown fuse, internal PCB failure, or battery problem.</li>
    <li>Note any unusual behaviors (clicks, beeps, flickering) when attempting to power on.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6. Check Safety Interlocks</h4>
  <p>Ensure compression sleeves and tubing are correctly connected. Some units have interlocks that prevent power-on if accessories are not properly seated.</p>

  <h4>7. Consider Internal Fuses or Circuitry</h4>
  <p>
    Certain SCD 700 units have an internal fuse accessible through a service panel.
    Only inspect if you are trained or authorized; improper handling can be hazardous.
    If unsure, skip and escalate to Clinical Engineering or the manufacturer.
  </p>

  <h3>If the Device Still Won’t Power On</h3>
  <p>
    If the unit remains unresponsive after completing all steps above, you have already:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirmed the power source</li>
    <li>Verified switch operation</li>
    <li>Inspected the cord and connectors</li>
    <li>Tested alternative outlets or batteries</li>
    <li>Checked indicator lights and accessory connections</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    At this point, the issue is likely internal (fuse blown, PCB failure, or battery fault) and cannot be corrected through bedside checks.
  </p>
  <p>Next Steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the unit from clinical service</li>
    <li>Clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>Send for repair or bench evaluation by Clinical Engineering or Cardinal Health</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Knowing when to escalate is part of good troubleshooting.</p>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>Example: “Kendall SCD 700 will not power on; no indicator lights.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>Example: “Power source verified, switch functional, cord and connectors intact, unit remains unresponsive. Suspected internal electronics failure (fuse or PCB).”</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Removed device from service, labeled Out of Service, sent for repair.”</li>
    <li>“Tagged for bench evaluation by CE department.”</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>AC or battery powered</li>
    <li>Outlet verified (yes/no)</li>
    <li>Power switch behavior</li>
    <li>Indicator lights observed (none, blinking, solid)</li>
    <li>Any unusual sounds when powering on</li>
    <li>Final disposition (returned to service, sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Not every power issue can be corrected at the bedside. Completing these steps ensures you have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out simple external causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
