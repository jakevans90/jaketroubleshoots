  <h3>What This Guide Helps With</h3>
  <p>
    This guide walks you through simple checks when a Philips V60 ventilator fails its self-test due to a leak detected.
    These steps focus on the most common and easiest things to verify before assuming the ventilator has failed.
  </p>
  <p>You do not need advanced technical skills to perform these checks — just follow the steps and observe carefully.</p>

  <h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>

  <h4>1. Check the Patient Circuit and Tubing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure the breathing circuit is fully connected at all connection points.</li>
    <li>Confirm there are no loose fittings, cracks, or obvious holes in the tubing.</li>
    <li>Ensure the circuit is properly seated on the ventilator outlet.</li>
    <li>Even a small gap or loose connection can cause a leak failure during self-test.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Inspect the Exhalation Port and Filter</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify the exhalation port is installed correctly.</li>
    <li>Check that the filter is present and seated properly.</li>
    <li>Look for moisture buildup or blockage that could affect airflow.</li>
    <li>Improper installation or obstruction can cause the ventilator to detect a leak.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Check the Humidifier (If Installed)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the humidifier chamber is seated correctly.</li>
    <li>Make sure the chamber is not cracked or leaking.</li>
    <li>Verify all humidifier tubing connections are tight.</li>
    <li>Leaks in the humidifier setup are a common cause of failed leak tests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Inspect the Mask or Test Plug</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If a mask is attached, make sure it is sealed properly.</li>
    <li>If running a self-test without a patient, ensure the test plug or circuit is capped correctly.</li>
    <li>An open or poorly sealed patient interface will cause the self-test to fail.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Try a Simple Reset</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Power the ventilator off.</li>
    <li>Re-seat the circuit, exhalation port, and humidifier connections.</li>
    <li>Power the ventilator back on and rerun the self-test.</li>
    <li>If the self-test passes, the ventilator may be returned to service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If the Self-Test Still Fails</h3>
  <p>
    If the ventilator continues to fail the self-test with a leak detected after completing the steps above, that’s okay — you have already checked the most common and simplest causes.
  </p>
  <p>You have already:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>confirmed the circuit is connected and free of visible damage</li>
    <li>verified the exhalation port and filter are installed correctly</li>
    <li>checked the humidifier chamber and tubing</li>
    <li>ensured the patient interface or test plug is sealed</li>
    <li>attempted a simple reset</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The best next step is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove the ventilator from clinical service</li>
    <li>clearly label it as Out of Service</li>
    <li>send it for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h3>
  <p>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What the user reported.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Ventilator fails self-test; leak detected.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What you observed or determined during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong> “Patient circuit, exhalation port, and humidifier inspected and reseated. No visible damage noted. Self-test continues to fail with leak detected. Suspected internal leak or valve failure.”
  </p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
    “Removed ventilator from service, labeled out of service, sent for repair.”<br>
    or<br>
    “Tagged for bench evaluation by CE.”
  </p>

  <h3>Helpful Details to Include (If Known)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Circuit inspected / replaced</li>
    <li>Exhalation port reseated</li>
    <li>Humidifier chamber checked</li>
    <li>Self-test passed / failed</li>
    <li>Any visible damage or moisture</li>
    <li>Final disposition (returned to service or sent for repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    Not every self-test failure is caused by an external setup issue — sometimes the ventilator’s internal components develop leaks that cannot be corrected at the bedside.
  </p>
  <p>Completing these steps means you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ ruled out common causes</li>
    <li>✔ protected patient safety</li>
    <li>✔ documented properly</li>
    <li>✔ avoided unnecessary guesswork</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
