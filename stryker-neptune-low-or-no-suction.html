  <h3>Model</h3>
  <p>Neptune</p>

  <h2>What This Guide Helps With</h2>
  <p>This guide addresses situations where the Stryker Neptune system has low suction performance or no suction at all during use.</p>
  <p>The focus is on logical, external checks first—such as tubing setup, canister configuration, vacuum settings, and simple mechanical blockages—before assuming internal pump or vacuum system failure.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h4>1. Ensure Patient Safety First</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm suction is no longer actively required on a patient.</li>
    <li>Move suction to a backup wall suction source if needed.</li>
    <li>Do not troubleshoot while actively connected to a surgical field.</li>
    <li>Patient safety always comes first.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Verify the Unit Is Powered On and Fully Booted</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm the unit is powered on.</li>
    <li>Check for any alarm messages on the display.</li>
    <li>Ensure the unit has completed startup and is not in standby mode.</li>
    <li>If the system is not fully operational, suction will not engage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3. Confirm Suction Mode and Vacuum Level Settings</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Verify the suction channel is selected and activated.</li>
    <li>Check that vacuum level is set appropriately (not set to minimum or zero).</li>
    <li>Ensure the foot pedal (if used) is connected and functioning.</li>
    <li>Low settings can appear as “no suction” to clinical staff.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4. Inspect All Tubing Connections</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Trace tubing from the surgical field to the Neptune inlet.</li>
    <li>Ensure all connections are fully seated and not loose.</li>
    <li>Check for cracked tubing, disconnected fittings, or split lines.</li>
    <li>Confirm the correct port is being used.</li>
    <li>Even a small air leak can significantly reduce vacuum performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>5. Check for Kinks or Occlusions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Inspect suction tubing for:</li>
    <li>Kinks</li>
    <li>Clots</li>
    <li>Collapsed sections</li>
    <li>Replace tubing if blockage is suspected.</li>
    <li>Mechanical obstruction is one of the most common causes of low suction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>6. Inspect the Canister Setup</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the collection canister is:</li>
    <li>Properly installed</li>
    <li>Locked into position</li>
    <li>Not overfilled</li>
    <li>Check that the lid and seals are intact.</li>
    <li>Confirm float shutoff has not engaged due to fluid level.</li>
    <li>An improperly seated canister or engaged float valve will stop suction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>7. Verify Filter and Hydrophobic Barrier Condition</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Inspect for wet or saturated filters.</li>
    <li>Replace filters if moisture has breached the hydrophobic barrier.</li>
    <li>Wet filters can completely block vacuum flow.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>8. Listen for Pump Activity</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>When suction is activated, listen for:</li>
    <li>Normal pump sound</li>
    <li>Unusual grinding</li>
    <li>No motor sound at all</li>
    <li>If the motor does not engage, internal vacuum pump failure may be present.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>9. Check for Alarm Indicators</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Common alarms that affect suction:</li>
    <li>Full canister</li>
    <li>Filter fault</li>
    <li>Vacuum system error</li>
    <li>Door or compartment not secured</li>
    <li>Resolve any indicated alarm conditions and retest.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If the Problem Persists</h2>
  <p>If:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Power is confirmed</li>
    <li>Settings are correct</li>
    <li>Tubing is clear</li>
    <li>Canister and filters are properly installed</li>
    <li>No external blockage is found</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Then the issue is likely internal (vacuum pump, pressure sensor, internal valve, or control board).</p>
  <p>At this point:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove the device from service</li>
    <li>Label it Out of Service</li>
    <li>Arrange for repair or bench evaluation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Knowing when to stop prevents unnecessary risk and protects patients.</p>

  <h2>Clinical Use Tip</h2>
  <p>Never attempt to troubleshoot suction loss while connected to an active surgical case.</p>
  <p>Always:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transition to wall suction first</li>
    <li>Confirm patient safety</li>
    <li>Then begin equipment troubleshooting</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Maintaining continuous suction during procedures is critical.</p>

  <h2>Work Order Documentation (CCR Method)</h2>

  <p><strong>CCR = Complaint, Cause, Resolution</strong></p>

  <h4>Complaint</h4>
  <p>What was reported by the clinical staff.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  “Staff reported Neptune unit had no suction during an OR case. Unit powered on but would not evacuate fluid.”</p>

  <h4>Cause</h4>
  <p>What was observed during troubleshooting.</p>
  <p><em>Example:</em><br>
  “Collection canister float shutoff engaged due to overfilled canister. Float valve blocking vacuum pathway.”</p>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>What action was taken.</p>
  <p><em>Examples:</em><br>
  “Replaced full canister, verified proper seating and seal. Tested suction at multiple vacuum settings. Unit functioning normally. Returned to service.”</p>

  <h2>Helpful Details to Include</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Outlet tested (if power concern)</li>
    <li>Alarm messages observed</li>
    <li>Vacuum level setting during testing</li>
    <li>Tubing replaced or swapped</li>
    <li>Filter condition</li>
    <li>Canister condition</li>
    <li>Final suction performance</li>
    <li>Final device status (Returned to Service or Sent to Repair)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  <p>Effective troubleshooting starts with simple, visible, mechanical checks before assuming internal failure. In surgical environments, suction reliability is directly tied to patient safety. Clear documentation and appropriate escalation demonstrate professional Clinical Engineering practice.</p>

  <p><strong>That is successful troubleshooting.</strong></p>
